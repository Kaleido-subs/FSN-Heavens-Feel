1
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:44,691
Saber!

2
00:00:46,526 --> 00:00:48,778
Saber!

3
00:00:56,327 --> 00:00:57,620
Saber!

4
00:01:01,207 --> 00:01:02,292
Saber!

5
00:01:24,647 --> 00:01:26,232
Saber...

6
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:31,821
You're safe.

7
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,740
I made it in-

8
00:01:46,669 --> 00:01:47,754
Saber!

9
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:02,810
How...

10
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:05,021
am I here again?

11
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,250
Who are you?

12
00:02:28,586 --> 00:02:29,879
What in the hell...

13
00:02:30,755 --> 00:02:33,800
are you?

14
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:08,626

28
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:23,516
Saber left for her home
all of a sudden, didn't she?

29
00:03:23,516 --> 00:03:25,017
The <i>site</i> is cordoned... Saber left for

30
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:25,393
<i>The site is cordoned...</i>

31
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:26,436
<i>The site is cordoned...</i>
Yeah.

32
00:03:26,436 --> 00:03:27,145
<i>The site is cordoned...</i>

33
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:29,147
<i>and we are unable to see inside.</i>

34
00:03:29,897 --> 00:03:35,361
<i>The collapse occurred in the building
and the area around the pond.</i>

35
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:35,778
<i>But now, The collapse occurred in the
building and the area around the pond.</i>

36
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:36,738
But now,

37
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:42,577
you no longer have to go out at night, right?

38
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:48,291
So, you're not going to be
in danger anymore, right?

39
00:03:53,963 --> 00:03:54,797
No.

40
00:03:55,715 --> 00:03:57,508
You're wrong about that, Sakura.

41
00:03:58,384 --> 00:04:00,845
I wasn't tagging along with Saber.

42
00:04:01,262 --> 00:04:03,973
Saber was the one
who was tagging along with me.

43
00:04:05,016 --> 00:04:08,561
I might be going out more often now.

44
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:15,902
But I don't want you to wait for me
at the entrance.

45
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:22,742
<i>That's right.</i>

46
00:04:22,742 --> 00:04:24,494
<i>It's not over yet.</i>

47
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,081
<i>The one I must fight...</i>

48
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:35,463
<i>is still in this city.</i>

<i>And what is its relationship with Zouken?</i>

57
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:19,442
<i>Is it working for him?</i>

58
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:23,237
<i>Or is he just taking advantage of it?</i>

59
00:06:25,197 --> 00:06:27,366
<i>I may have to ask Tohsaka about this.</i>

60
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:37,710
What the...

61
00:06:42,798 --> 00:06:46,052
You're still alive, Big Brother!

62
00:06:53,684 --> 00:06:56,395
Tell me your name.

63
00:06:57,688 --> 00:06:59,982
Your name, Big Brother.

64
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,026
S-Sure.

65
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:05,529
I'm Shirou. Shirou Emiya.

66
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,781
Shirou!

67
00:07:07,198 --> 00:07:08,741
Shirou! Shirou! Right?

68
00:07:09,992 --> 00:07:10,993
Yep!

69
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:19,585
H-Hold on!

70
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:21,087
Hold on a second!

71
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:23,798
We're enemies, aren't we, Illyasviel?

72
00:07:23,798 --> 00:07:25,383
Just call me Ill ya!

73
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,428
Masters can only fight
each other at night.

74
00:07:29,428 --> 00:07:32,264
I came here to chat with you, Shirou.

75
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,143
Look, you suddenly hacked away at me,

76
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:38,854
and now you wanna chat with me?

77
00:07:39,355 --> 00:07:42,108
What? That was just an accident!

78
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,238
It was all because you jumped in recklessly
even though you're weak!

79
00:07:47,738 --> 00:07:51,242
I could kill you right here, right now, too.

80
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:55,621
Without Saber, you'd be killed in an instant!

81
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:02,378
Besides,

82
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:05,840
I've been waiting for this chance
all this time.

83
00:08:06,424 --> 00:08:08,300
So, don't I deserve a little chat?

84
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,225
So, you're living
in the castle in the forest.

85
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:17,601
All alone?

86
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:19,645
No, with Sella and Liz.

87
00:08:19,895 --> 00:08:24,608
I sneaked out behind Sella's back
just to see you!

88
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:26,736
You should feel honored!

89
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:28,487
Oh, I guess.

90
00:08:31,365 --> 00:08:34,118
Then, can I ask you one more thing?

91
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,748
Does the name Kiritsugu Emiya
ring any bells?

92
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,131
Ill ya?

93
00:08:49,508 --> 00:08:50,718
Don't know.

94
00:08:51,135 --> 00:08:54,597
I don't know a name like that.

95
00:08:55,973 --> 00:08:57,558
I'm going home.

96
00:09:00,186 --> 00:09:00,978
Ill ya!

97
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:07,318
Huh?

98
00:09:07,902 --> 00:09:09,278
Emiya?

99
00:09:14,408 --> 00:09:15,701
Tohsaka!

100
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:23,876
Good timing!

101
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:26,879
I wanted to have a chat with you, too.

102
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:31,217
We could chat at school, too, you know.

103
00:09:32,176 --> 00:09:34,428
Archer, can you make us some tea?

104
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:38,182
You don't want to?

105
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:40,142
What's with that face?

106
00:09:40,643 --> 00:09:42,895
Jeez, fine!

107
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:55,324
Huh?

108
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:57,910
This is...

109
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:02,581
What are you doing?

110
00:10:03,082 --> 00:10:06,585
Now, let's discuss our game plan.

111
00:11:01,974 --> 00:11:05,811
I have to get dinner ready.

112
00:11:14,486 --> 00:11:17,740
Why didn't you tell me earlier
that Sakura had a fever?

113
00:11:17,948 --> 00:11:20,743
'Cause you didn't let me interrupt you!

114
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,746
It's open.

115
00:11:24,622 --> 00:11:27,416
Sakura, are you awake?

116
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:42,181
Emiya?

117
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,183
Jeez!

118
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:02,117
Shinji! Let go of Sakura!

119
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:08,540
Shinji!

120
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,294
Don't worry, Sakura.

121
00:12:12,753 --> 00:12:15,422
I won't kill Emiya or anything.

122
00:12:15,756 --> 00:12:20,052
I just want him
to feel a little pain, that's all.

123
00:12:21,303 --> 00:12:22,972
Fight with Rider.

124
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:25,099
If you survive,

125
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:27,476
I don't mind letting go of her.

126
00:12:29,061 --> 00:12:30,729
Get him, Rider!

127
00:12:33,065 --> 00:12:36,402
If you were going to fight,

128
00:12:37,736 --> 00:12:40,322
you shouldn't have come alone.

129
00:13:20,696 --> 00:13:22,323
What's wrong, Emiya?

130
00:13:22,531 --> 00:13:26,035
It'd be so boring
if you croaked too easily!

131
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,003
You won since you have good endurance.

132
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,303
Good! Now, don't hold back anymore.

133
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:49,725
Just kill him off right now, Rider!

134
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:51,018
Stop it, Big Brother-

135
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,542
Sakura...

136
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:19,129
<i>Senpai!</i>

137
00:14:32,101 --> 00:14:32,976
Wh...

138
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:35,646
Why?

139
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:48,909
Stagecraft...

140
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:18,397
Rider!

141
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:21,150
Kill him!

142
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:56,143
T-Tohsaka?

143
00:15:56,768 --> 00:15:58,395
Why?

144
00:15:58,896 --> 00:16:02,274
Emiya and I have formed a coalition.

145
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:06,528
It just so happens
that we were together all day today.

146
00:16:07,946 --> 00:16:10,073
Because you used Sakura as bait,

147
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:14,703
you completely made yourself my enemy.

148
00:16:16,705 --> 00:16:18,040
Sakura...

149
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,836
Sakura, Sakura, Sakura,
Sakura, Sakura, Sakura!

150
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:25,923
Why do you care about someone like her?

151
00:16:26,298 --> 00:16:28,509
I was the one who became a Master!

152
00:16:33,847 --> 00:16:35,516
Stand up, Rider!

153
00:16:37,267 --> 00:16:38,685
Damn you!

154
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:41,813
Don't...

155
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:48,028
Rider, please don't...

156
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:49,780
Stop right now!

157
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:00,707
— Sakura!
- Emiya, get down!

158
00:17:16,431 --> 00:17:17,516
You gotta be kidding.

159
00:17:17,808 --> 00:17:18,642
This is...

160
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,477
really Rider?

161
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:28,110
Good going, Rider!

162
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,654
Keep at it and get rid of them all!

163
00:17:33,323 --> 00:17:35,242
Hey, Rider!

164
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,329
I see.

165
00:17:40,372 --> 00:17:42,416
Matou's bloodline is already obsolete

166
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,627
and can't produce anyone
who can handle Magecraft.

167
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:49,214
I'd thought Zouken was the one
who summoned Rider

168
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:51,842
and had lent her to Shinji.

169
00:17:52,342 --> 00:17:55,220
But it was actually a lot simpler than that.

170
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:57,264
Tohsaka?

171
00:17:57,764 --> 00:17:59,600
In the current state of the Matou family,

172
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,020
the one most fit to become a Master...

173
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:08,859
...is the rightful heir of Matou,

174
00:18:09,526 --> 00:18:12,571
their current Mage. And that's you,

175
00:18:12,904 --> 00:18:14,114
Sakura.

176
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:18,368
Sakura...

177
00:18:18,994 --> 00:18:20,537
is a Master?

178
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:22,873
The transfer of Command Spells...

179
00:18:23,415 --> 00:18:27,044
A Command Spell for Rider
to obey Shinji Matou's orders.

180
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:31,965
With that, Shinji has become Rider's Master.

181
00:18:31,965 --> 00:18:32,215
Hey...
With that, Shinji has become Rider's Master.

182
00:18:32,215 --> 00:18:32,883
Hey... Meanwhile, you lost
your authority as her Master

183
00:18:32,883 --> 00:18:35,719
Meanwhile, you lost
your authority as her Master

184
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:38,138
and became an ordinary Mage.

185
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:42,434
Who are you guys looking at?

186
00:18:43,143 --> 00:18:45,812
Because the Matou family is the one
that created Command Spells,

187
00:18:46,396 --> 00:18:49,691
such a trick was possible,
wasn't it, Sakura?

188
00:18:55,322 --> 00:18:56,281
Hey!

189
00:18:56,531 --> 00:18:57,949
Look over here!

190
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:02,162
We haven't finished yet!

191
00:19:02,496 --> 00:19:04,373
One more time, Sakura!

192
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:07,668
Give me control over her one more time!

193
00:19:10,962 --> 00:19:13,590
Why are you acting
so goody-goody after all this?

194
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,009
You have one more Command Spell!

195
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:17,678
Use that, and...

196
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:22,307
Shinji, Rider will become free from you
if you don't have Command Spells.

197
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:25,268
And when that happens, even if you make
a False Attendant's Writings,

198
00:19:25,268 --> 00:19:27,896
it'll quickly be burned up,
and that'll be it for you.

199
00:19:28,939 --> 00:19:31,942
Because you were only controlling her
with borrowed Command Spells,

200
00:19:32,234 --> 00:19:35,404
you were never a Master to begin with.

201
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:44,454
Shinji...

202
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:50,377
That's right.

203
00:19:50,627 --> 00:19:51,878
I knew that.

204
00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:54,423
I knew that! I knew that!

205
00:19:54,423 --> 00:19:55,841
I knew that!

206
00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:00,178
I knew all along, from the beginning,
I'd never fit this role!

207
00:20:03,974 --> 00:20:05,392
Since I'm not a Master,

208
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:07,644
you should do it.

209
00:20:08,353 --> 00:20:12,733
Kill them all in my place, Sakura.

210
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:18,363
No, Big Brother.

211
00:20:19,406 --> 00:20:20,866
Let's stop it here!

212
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,411
You broke your promise.

213
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:27,622
You said you wouldn't kill Senpai!

214
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:31,376
So, please...

215
00:20:33,128 --> 00:20:34,963
Then, fine.

216
00:20:36,006 --> 00:20:37,382
Why don't you just...

217
00:20:37,674 --> 00:20:38,842
die?

218
00:20:48,977 --> 00:20:49,936
Sakura!

219
00:20:50,729 --> 00:20:52,105
Senpai...

220
00:20:52,606 --> 00:20:53,648
No!

221
00:20:54,065 --> 00:20:55,358
Don't look at me!

222
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:08,705
Sakura...

223
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:19,674
Looks like she can't control it.

224
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:23,512
Get away from this place!

225
00:21:23,512 --> 00:21:26,264
If we carelessly feed her
magical energy, we can't revert her!

226
00:21:29,142 --> 00:21:30,977
Please don't get in our way.

227
00:21:31,311 --> 00:21:32,646
Pull back, Rider!

228
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:35,398
Your master is running out of control!

229
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:39,194
At this rate, she'll use up
all her magical energy and self-destruct!

230
00:21:39,444 --> 00:21:43,573
It simply means she must take in
more magical energy than she's expending.

231
00:21:46,493 --> 00:21:50,455
So, a change in your master
hasn't changed your rotten nature!

232
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:07,180
A bounded field?

233
00:22:14,312 --> 00:22:15,313
Stop it.

234
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:18,817
Stop this already, Rider!

235
00:22:19,693 --> 00:22:21,152
I...

236
00:22:21,528 --> 00:22:25,365
didn't summon you because I wanted
to do something like this!

237
00:22:26,449 --> 00:22:28,451
I cannot abide by that command.

238
00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:33,456
I prioritize your life
more than anything else.

239
00:22:55,312 --> 00:22:58,315
No way! Mystic Eyes of Petrification?

240
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:00,317
Tohsaka!

241
00:23:19,002 --> 00:23:19,836
Tohsaka!

242
00:23:31,348 --> 00:23:35,393
2000s!

243
00:23:42,984 --> 00:23:44,235
Saki...

244
00:23:45,362 --> 00:23:46,446
Pa."

245
00:23:58,249 --> 00:23:59,292
Sakura!

246
00:24:06,257 --> 00:24:07,133
Emiya,

247
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:08,802
are you all right?

248
00:24:10,303 --> 00:24:11,596
Tohsaka!

249
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:17,185
So, you're finally awake.

250
00:24:18,061 --> 00:24:21,815
I just finished treatment on Sakura Matou.

251
00:24:22,273 --> 00:24:23,441
How's Sakura?

252
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:25,694
Is Sakura all right?

253
00:24:25,944 --> 00:24:27,237
Calm down.

254
00:24:27,696 --> 00:24:29,990
We brought her here with Rider's help.

255
00:24:30,281 --> 00:24:32,575
Kirei, how is Sakura doing?

256
00:24:33,076 --> 00:24:37,747
She's not stable yet,
but her life's been spared for now.

257
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:41,292
Hold on a second!

258
00:24:41,835 --> 00:24:44,754
What happened
to all of your Magical Crests?

259
00:24:48,591 --> 00:24:53,388
I had no choice but to use them all
for the treatment of Sakura Matou.

260
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:55,390
All of them?

261
00:24:56,266 --> 00:24:59,978
And the result of that treatment...

262
00:25:02,522 --> 00:25:04,232
Crest Worms?

263
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:07,861
What the hell are they, um...

264
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:11,239
Just think of them
as living Magical Circuits.

265
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:14,868
A Crest Worm, once it sinks its teeth in,

266
00:25:15,201 --> 00:25:21,124
infiltrates every last inch of your body,
and voraciously devours your spirit.

267
00:25:21,666 --> 00:25:25,336
It pierces through
and lubricates skin with its mucus

268
00:25:25,587 --> 00:25:28,048
and feeds itself by stimulating

269
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:31,593
then decomposing the part of the brain
controlling pleasure.

270
00:25:32,677 --> 00:25:33,803
As a result,

271
00:25:34,262 --> 00:25:39,142
women swarmed by these bugs
are completely violated

272
00:25:39,726 --> 00:25:44,147
in both mind and body,
and thus destroyed.

273
00:25:45,356 --> 00:25:47,734
Sakura Matou is also-

274
00:25:47,734 --> 00:25:48,902
Stop it!

275
00:25:50,695 --> 00:25:54,240
I thought you'd need some explanation.

276
00:25:55,116 --> 00:25:57,118
As long as that thing is inside her body,

277
00:25:57,368 --> 00:26:01,331
her magical energy, which is her life energy,
is being sucked away limitless.

278
00:26:01,331 --> 00:26:02,916
If you leave her like that,

279
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:05,543
it will ultimately kill her.

280
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,129
The operation was a success, right?

281
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:10,340
Not completely.

282
00:26:11,216 --> 00:26:13,259
The worms accumulated for 11 years.

283
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:17,388
If we forcefully pry them out of her,
her body won't last.

284
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:20,141
To completely be rid of them,

285
00:26:20,642 --> 00:26:24,395
that's something you'd actually
have to rely on the Holy Grail for.

286
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:39,327
Tohsaka?

287
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:47,585
As the one in charge of Fuyuki,
I'll take care of her.

288
00:26:51,673 --> 00:26:53,299
Take care of her?

289
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:56,427
You mean Sakura Matou?

290
00:26:56,928 --> 00:27:01,850
Yes. I can't allow Mages
who can't control their powers to live.

291
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:06,187
She is already nothing
more than a Master gone mad.

292
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,398
Even if...

293
00:27:08,857 --> 00:27:12,277
she is your biological little sister?

294
00:27:16,906 --> 00:27:18,324
Little sister?

295
00:27:24,372 --> 00:27:28,126
The Tohsakas originally had two children.

296
00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:31,129
But Magecraft is taught only to one child.

297
00:27:32,213 --> 00:27:34,841
I inherited the Magecraft
of the Tohsakas.

298
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:39,512
The Matou or Makiri family's bloodline
had already been severed.

299
00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:42,140
So, Sakura was adopted by them

300
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,392
as the heir of the family.

301
00:27:44,726 --> 00:27:45,935
Then...

302
00:27:46,477 --> 00:27:49,230
Sakura and I are sisters by blood.

303
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,319
Though, we've never called
each other as such.

304
00:27:54,652 --> 00:27:58,239
Hold on, Tohsaka!
Then, all the more reason to...

305
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:08,124
If I leave her alone like this,

306
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:11,002
the same thing will happen again.

307
00:28:12,754 --> 00:28:14,881
To innocent bystanders, next time.

308
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,342
No matter who they may be.

309
00:28:18,092 --> 00:28:19,677
That's why I...

310
00:28:20,762 --> 00:28:22,305
am going to kill her.

311
00:29:00,468 --> 00:29:02,220
<i>You win, Sakura.</i>

312
00:29:02,845 --> 00:29:05,348
<i>So, I'll give you this.</i>

313
00:29:30,164 --> 00:29:32,041
<i>This is the second time...</i>

314
00:29:32,709 --> 00:29:35,253
<i>I've received something important...</i>

315
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,589
<i>from someone dear to me!</i>

316
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:53,688
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

317
00:30:07,702 --> 00:30:08,870
<i>Sakura.</i> ..

318
00:30:09,495 --> 00:30:11,664
<i>I've gotta find her before Tohsaka does.</i>

319
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:15,626
<i>But...</i>

320
00:30:16,127 --> 00:30:17,962
<i>after finding Sakura,</i>

321
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,089
<i>what am I...</i>

322
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,429
Good evening, Shirou.

323
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:32,477
Didn't you say we fight at night?

324
00:30:33,603 --> 00:30:36,856
No. You're no longer a Master.

325
00:30:38,024 --> 00:30:40,193
I know everything, you see.

326
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,489
Rider's Master has also fallen,
so only two more remain.

327
00:30:45,114 --> 00:30:48,201
You want to save Rider's Master,

328
00:30:48,451 --> 00:30:49,827
but you can't find her, right?

329
00:30:49,827 --> 00:30:51,120
Shut up!

330
00:31:04,884 --> 00:31:06,886
Shirou, you look like you're going to cry.

331
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:10,640
Ill ya, aren't you mad at me?

332
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,517
No, I'm not.

333
00:31:13,017 --> 00:31:15,645
I'm on your side, Shirou.

334
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,691
On my side?

335
00:31:23,152 --> 00:31:24,695
You asked me this morning...

336
00:31:24,946 --> 00:31:28,157
about Kiritsugu... I actually knew him.

337
00:31:29,117 --> 00:31:33,871
The reason I was born
is to win the Holy Grail War,

338
00:31:34,205 --> 00:31:39,043
but my own personal objective
was to kill Kiritsugu and you, Shirou.

339
00:31:40,336 --> 00:31:41,629
But...

340
00:31:42,046 --> 00:31:46,050
if you want to protect
someone dear to you,

341
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:49,971
I'll be on your side!

342
00:31:50,847 --> 00:31:54,809
It's only natural to protect
the person you're in love with.

343
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,104
I know that!

344
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:32,221
I've... now lost all places I can return to!

345
00:32:42,982 --> 00:32:43,900
Sakura...

346
00:32:48,988 --> 00:32:51,908
Senpai?

347
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:54,702
Sakura...

348
00:32:56,496 --> 00:33:00,500
Let's go home. You're not fully
over your cold yet, right?

349
00:33:03,127 --> 00:33:05,004
I can't go home.

350
00:33:05,963 --> 00:33:09,842
That thing earlier...
It wasn't a poison or anything.

351
00:33:10,301 --> 00:33:13,346
It's only an elixir
that heightens the senses.

352
00:33:14,305 --> 00:33:20,269
With only some of that,
I lost myself and hurt you!

353
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:22,146
I'm not hurt at all.

354
00:33:22,396 --> 00:33:24,649
I'm totally okay with something like that.

355
00:33:26,817 --> 00:33:28,861
I am a Mage of the Matou family,

356
00:33:29,111 --> 00:33:31,405
and kept that fact
hidden from you for all this time!

357
00:33:31,906 --> 00:33:36,410
And I didn't tell you
I became a Master, either.

358
00:33:36,661 --> 00:33:38,871
The reason why I was going
to your place so much

359
00:33:38,871 --> 00:33:41,582
was because I was scared
to stand up to Grandfather!

360
00:33:41,582 --> 00:33:45,711
I said I was helping you out,
but I've been fooling you all along!

361
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:51,676
Always...

362
00:33:52,218 --> 00:33:54,095
I always thought...

363
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:57,723
I'm not someone
who can stay at your side.

364
00:33:58,975 --> 00:34:01,561
So, I kept thinking
that I'd end all of this today,

365
00:34:01,936 --> 00:34:05,106
and, starting tomorrow,
I'd pretend I didn't know you.

366
00:34:06,524 --> 00:34:09,735
That I'd ignore you even if we pass
each other in the campus hallway,

367
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:13,197
and pretend I didn't know you after school.

368
00:34:13,447 --> 00:34:16,033
That I'd go home all by myself

369
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:19,287
and forget everything
that has happened up until now!

370
00:34:22,498 --> 00:34:24,458
But I couldn't do it!

371
00:34:25,251 --> 00:34:28,921
It was scarier than the moment when I put
a knife to my wrist to commit suicide.

372
00:34:29,171 --> 00:34:33,759
I was scared of deceiving you,
and I was scared of stopping the deceit!

373
00:34:34,427 --> 00:34:37,221
Everything around me was just scary!

374
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,309
I was no longer able to take
even one step forward!

375
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:44,228
I just didn't know what to do at all!

376
00:34:47,732 --> 00:34:52,862
I wanted to protect my time
together with you going forward, as well.

377
00:34:54,071 --> 00:34:55,531
For me...

378
00:34:55,906 --> 00:34:58,534
For me, that was the only thing...

379
00:34:59,994 --> 00:35:02,580
that means anything to me.

380
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,299
<i>The person I want to protect...</i>

381
00:35:13,924 --> 00:35:15,760
<i>The person who is important to me...</i>

382
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:21,432
<i>If I don't want that person
to cry anymore...</i>

383
00:35:23,476 --> 00:35:25,394
<i>If nobody is going to reprimand Sakura,</i>

384
00:35:26,145 --> 00:35:29,398
<i>and she has to reprimand herself...</i>

385
00:35:31,192 --> 00:35:32,818
<i>I'll lead her by the hand</i>

386
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:36,238
<i>and make sure to take her
to a brighter place.</i>

387
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:40,368
<i>Even if nobody were to forgive her...</i>

388
00:35:48,084 --> 00:35:49,168
I will...

389
00:35:50,086 --> 00:35:53,798
continue to forgive you in your place.

390
00:35:55,591 --> 00:35:57,343
So don't cry anymore.

391
00:35:58,094 --> 00:36:02,056
I fully understand now
that you are a bad person.

392
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:10,398
I don't know when I'll lose sight
of myself again, like I did earlier.

393
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:13,734
I'm sure I'll do something
that'll be simply irreparable.

394
00:36:14,485 --> 00:36:18,823
So, where are you saying
someone like me can go home to?

395
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:28,499
This is your home, Sakura.

396
00:36:36,632 --> 00:36:37,800
I...

397
00:36:38,884 --> 00:36:40,428
I'm...

398
00:36:41,178 --> 00:36:43,556
not a virgin.

399
00:36:46,016 --> 00:36:48,978
My first time was quite a long time ago.

400
00:36:50,146 --> 00:36:51,897
That's not all.

401
00:36:52,314 --> 00:36:54,066
Ever since that first time,

402
00:36:54,316 --> 00:36:57,820
my body has been touched
by unnatural things.

403
00:36:58,112 --> 00:37:00,823
I don't deserve to be protected by you!

404
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,206
I will protect you.

405
00:37:09,874 --> 00:37:11,625
No matter what happens,

406
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:14,628
even if you try to kill yourself,

407
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:17,590
I'll protect you, Sakura.

408
00:37:20,509 --> 00:37:22,928
Senpai...

409
00:37:27,641 --> 00:37:32,104
I will become a hero of justice
just for you, Sakura!

410
00:37:35,065 --> 00:37:37,067
You can't do that, Senpai.

411
00:37:38,152 --> 00:37:42,531
I'm sure I will end up hurting you!

412
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:47,411
I will hurt you...

413
00:37:57,213 --> 00:37:58,172
Let's go home.

414
00:38:16,982 --> 00:38:18,484
Sakura...

415
00:38:20,736 --> 00:38:21,987
Big Sis...

416
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,450
Tohsaka-senpai...

417
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,559
Shirou Emiya...

418
00:38:53,143 --> 00:38:57,273
If you kept the belief
you've been sticking with, continue to do so.

419
00:38:57,606 --> 00:38:59,441
The results are obvious.

420
00:39:00,484 --> 00:39:03,904
But if you're going to choose
a different path,

421
00:39:04,405 --> 00:39:06,949
there is no future for Shirou Emiya.

422
00:39:08,158 --> 00:39:11,370
You will end up losing
anything and everything.

423
00:39:26,635 --> 00:39:29,305
You must be tired.
Take your time and rest up.

424
00:39:31,432 --> 00:39:32,892
O-Okay.

425
00:39:34,226 --> 00:39:36,353
What's wrong, Sakura?

426
00:39:36,854 --> 00:39:38,397
Do you have a fever?

427
00:39:38,856 --> 00:39:40,858
You were in the rain for so long.

428
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:45,362
I-It's not a cold.

429
00:39:46,113 --> 00:39:47,948
My magical energy is a bit...

430
00:39:48,616 --> 00:39:49,909
lacking.

431
00:39:52,995 --> 00:39:56,457
Is there anything I can help you with?

432
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,710
Um...

433
00:40:03,756 --> 00:40:05,382
Would you like to...

434
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:12,056
No! I'll be fine if you could give me
a small amount of your blood.

435
00:40:12,806 --> 00:40:14,808
S-Sure.

436
00:40:17,895 --> 00:40:18,812
Is this okay?

437
00:40:20,731 --> 00:40:21,815
Yes.

438
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,928
Are you okay?

439
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,354
I-I see.

440
00:41:00,604 --> 00:41:03,941
Well then, g-good night.

441
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:06,443
Okay.

442
00:41:17,204 --> 00:41:20,457
I shouldn't go any further!

443
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:24,628
I can't contaminate him
any more than this!

444
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,907
Sakura, can you make a soup stock?

445
00:41:54,783 --> 00:41:55,784
Okay!

446
00:41:56,994 --> 00:41:59,079
What about the spinach?

447
00:41:59,329 --> 00:42:01,457
Let's dress it with sesame today.

448
00:42:02,124 --> 00:42:04,001
Sakura, eggs.

449
00:42:04,251 --> 00:42:05,169
Here!

450
00:42:11,133 --> 00:42:12,342
- Thank you for the meal!
- Thank you for the meal!

451
00:42:18,724 --> 00:42:21,977
It's been a while
since we did this last time.

452
00:42:22,978 --> 00:42:23,937
Yes.

453
00:42:27,858 --> 00:42:29,234
You're not gonna eat?

454
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,237
It's okay. Don't be shy.

455
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:39,495
We Servants don't require
the intake of nutrients the same way you do.

456
00:42:39,995 --> 00:42:41,080
Is that so?

457
00:42:41,497 --> 00:42:43,999
Saber used to eat a lot.

458
00:42:46,752 --> 00:42:49,880
Your way doesn't suit me.

459
00:42:50,923 --> 00:42:52,007
Well then,

460
00:42:52,883 --> 00:42:54,009
if that's the case...

461
00:43:05,062 --> 00:43:06,730
For our strategy from now on...

462
00:43:07,356 --> 00:43:09,441
I will have Sakura win,

463
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:11,735
and have her use the Holy Grail.

464
00:43:12,611 --> 00:43:16,156
But I think Sakura had better not go outside.

465
00:43:16,698 --> 00:43:19,660
It'd be dangerous
if she saw Zouken in person.

466
00:43:20,953 --> 00:43:22,996
I believe that idea is correct.

467
00:43:23,372 --> 00:43:28,085
However, how will you defeat that Mage?

468
00:43:30,629 --> 00:43:34,091
I think we should cooperate
with the other Masters.

469
00:43:34,842 --> 00:43:38,011
Who else is left?

470
00:43:39,012 --> 00:43:42,558
Tohsaka's Archer, Sakura's Rider...

471
00:43:43,433 --> 00:43:46,145
Zouken has his Assassin in tow.

472
00:43:46,895 --> 00:43:49,189
Other than that, Illya's...

473
00:43:49,648 --> 00:43:51,108
Berserker.

474
00:43:55,904 --> 00:43:57,906
Is it going to be all right?

475
00:43:58,323 --> 00:43:59,950
Yeah, probably.

476
00:44:00,742 --> 00:44:03,912
Don't go outside, okay?

477
00:44:11,545 --> 00:44:13,505
Are you regretting this?

478
00:44:15,924 --> 00:44:20,053
I can't have regrets
after coming this far.

479
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:25,559
Rider, if things get dangerous,
bring Senpai back home.

480
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,437
But Sakura...

481
00:44:29,563 --> 00:44:31,899
I think the one we should be careful of is...

482
00:44:32,232 --> 00:44:35,777
that priest instead of the elderly man.

483
00:44:38,197 --> 00:44:39,615
Right.

484
00:44:39,948 --> 00:44:43,327
I actually think so, as well.

485
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:47,581
But rest assured, Rider.

486
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:52,502
Because there's no way
he can win against me.

487
00:44:55,881 --> 00:44:56,798
Well then...

488
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:43,720
<i>Lipase!</i>

489
00:46:04,908 --> 00:46:09,037
I got it! All I have to do
is keep him from going outside.

490
00:46:09,288 --> 00:46:13,625
That way, he won't be
in any danger again, right?

491
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,171
Huh?

492
00:46:18,422 --> 00:46:22,092
What was I just thinking about?

493
00:46:47,951 --> 00:46:50,912
Talk about rough trekking.

494
00:47:00,047 --> 00:47:01,965
I guess it wants me to follow, huh?

495
00:47:12,309 --> 00:47:13,143
Huh?

496
00:47:15,812 --> 00:47:17,272
It's gone.

497
00:47:23,737 --> 00:47:25,739
What happened to this?

498
00:48:09,241 --> 00:48:13,578
You sure are a cowardly Servant,
much like your master.

499
00:48:13,995 --> 00:48:17,249
I can't feel any intent
to fight against us.

500
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:21,670
Do you value your life that much?

501
00:48:23,088 --> 00:48:25,590
Of course I do.

502
00:48:27,384 --> 00:48:30,137
My wish is for eternal life.

503
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,098
Look at this body!

504
00:48:33,515 --> 00:48:36,768
With each moment it rots,
emitting a foul odor,

505
00:48:36,768 --> 00:48:39,980
losing the knowledge
I have stashed away within.

506
00:48:40,647 --> 00:48:46,278
Do you understand the pain
of rotting away while you're still alive?

507
00:48:47,612 --> 00:48:51,116
No human is fearless of death.

508
00:48:54,453 --> 00:48:58,665
If that was going to grant me my wish,

509
00:49:00,459 --> 00:49:05,797
I would run around the entire world
killing every human one by one.

510
00:49:12,429 --> 00:49:13,847
I'm disgusted.

511
00:49:14,806 --> 00:49:19,311
You have lost sight
of things that much, Makiri?

512
00:49:20,312 --> 00:49:23,690
Remember again
what we earnestly wished for.

513
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:27,819
Remember where our thirst
for achieving the miracle came from.

514
00:49:28,862 --> 00:49:32,991
And why we've been striving to reach
the point where we're not human...

515
00:49:32,991 --> 00:49:36,578
while keeping our human bodies.

516
00:49:41,666 --> 00:49:44,711
Quite the words from a mere puppet.

517
00:49:45,045 --> 00:49:48,673
<i>Of course they've 'are-programmed you, huh?</i>

518
00:49:49,841 --> 00:49:52,093
Playtime is now over.

519
00:49:53,512 --> 00:49:58,642
I, Zouken Matou, will take
the Einzberns' Holy Grail.

520
00:50:29,506 --> 00:50:31,258
No, don't, Berserker!

521
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:58,618
Tohsaka! Why?

522
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,956
I never thought you'd come up
with the same idea, Emiya.

523
00:51:30,442 --> 00:51:31,901
You gotta be kidding me!

524
00:51:50,879 --> 00:51:52,464
Get away from there!

525
00:51:52,464 --> 00:51:55,550
If that thing gets you,
you won't be able to come back!

526
00:52:08,605 --> 00:52:10,732
The score has been settled.

527
00:52:11,274 --> 00:52:12,901
I'll leave you to do the rest.

528
00:52:13,151 --> 00:52:17,739
Don't let the Einzbern girl go
after all this effort.

529
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:29,918
Berserker!

530
00:52:39,052 --> 00:52:40,053
Ill ya!

531
00:52:55,318 --> 00:52:57,987
Jeez, Archer...

532
00:53:01,825 --> 00:53:03,118
Berserker...

533
00:53:15,672 --> 00:53:18,800
I will be your opponent.

534
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,766
Archer!

535
00:53:28,852 --> 00:53:30,103
I'm counting on you.

536
00:54:00,508 --> 00:54:01,551
This is the end.

537
00:54:09,976 --> 00:54:12,103
A genuine Heroic Spirit...

538
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,148
could not fight
the Cursed Boundary Layer of that thing.

539
00:54:15,648 --> 00:54:20,361
At present, you are not much different
from the phantoms filling this forest.

540
00:54:41,216 --> 00:54:42,509
Berserker!

541
00:54:51,017 --> 00:54:52,560
This doesn't look good.

542
00:54:54,103 --> 00:54:55,563
Berserker...

543
00:54:56,105 --> 00:54:57,357
Berserker...

544
00:54:58,191 --> 00:55:01,903
Berserker!

545
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:20,425
No... No!

546
01:54:58,922 --> 01:55:00,965
My duties are complete.

547
01:55:01,341 --> 01:55:03,468
I will leave you to do the rest.

548
01:55:04,010 --> 01:55:07,472
How gracious of you.
I can regain the points I have lost.

549
01:55:12,185 --> 01:55:14,020
Saber!

550
01:55:33,748 --> 01:55:34,541
Ill ya!

551
01:55:49,639 --> 01:55:50,807
That's far enough.

552
01:55:51,349 --> 01:55:53,643
You're of no use.

553
01:56:01,484 --> 01:56:04,529
You can't kill a puny boy
unless you do a sneak attack, can you?

554
01:56:04,779 --> 01:56:05,864
Pathetic.

555
01:56:08,867 --> 01:56:11,953
How could you come here?

556
01:56:12,453 --> 01:56:13,705
Who knows?

557
01:56:13,955 --> 01:56:15,206
Archer!

558
01:56:16,749 --> 01:56:17,584
Hurry!

559
01:56:18,626 --> 01:56:20,837
If that thing catches up, it's all over!

560
01:56:30,054 --> 01:56:33,016
We'll talk later. Run, brat!

561
01:56:33,558 --> 01:56:35,518
Now that you've taken Illya's hand,

562
01:56:35,768 --> 01:56:37,687
protect her until the very end!

563
01:56:45,820 --> 01:56:46,738
Let's go!

564
01:57:08,301 --> 01:57:13,301
HOW?
