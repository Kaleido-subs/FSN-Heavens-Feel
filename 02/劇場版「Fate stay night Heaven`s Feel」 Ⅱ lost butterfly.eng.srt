00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,711
Saber!

2
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,757
Saber!

3
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,599
Saber!

4
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,271
Saber!

5
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,169
Saber...

6
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,800
You're safe.

7
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,760
I made it in—

8
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,774
Saber!

9
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:02,748
How...

10
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,958
am I here again?

11
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,188
Who are you?

12
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,816
What in the hell...

13
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,737
are you?

14
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,563
On-site investigations are continuing,

<i>but as the police entered the destruction site

<i>I'm here in front of Ryudou Temple,
Y-Yeah,</i> What <i>is it?</i>

28
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,366

<i>I'm here in front of Ryudou Temple,

00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:21,076

00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,248
<i>The site is cordoned...
Yeah.</i>

36
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,040
<i>The site is cordoned...</i>

37
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,084
<i>and we are unable to see inside.</i>

38
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:35,215
<i>The collapse occurred in the building
and the area around the pond.</i>

39
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,216
But now,

40
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:42,514
you no longer have to so out
at night, right?

41
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:48,186
So, you're not going to be
in danger anymore, right?

42
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,735
No.

43
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,446
You're wrong about that, Sakura.

44
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,782
I wasn't tagging along with Saber.

45
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,910
Saber was the one
who was tagging along with me.

46
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,498
I might be going out more often now.

47
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:15,922
But I don't want you to wait for me
at the entrance.

48
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:22,637
<i>That's right.</i>

49
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,431
<i>It's not over yet.</i>

50
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,019
<i>The one I must fight...</i>

51
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,400
<i>is still in this city.</i>

00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,751
<i>And what is its relationship
with Zouken?</i>

59
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,379
<i>Is it working for him?</i>

60
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,174
<i>Or is he just taking advantage of it?</i>

61
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,304
<i>I may have to ask Tohsaka about this.</i>

62
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,647
What the...

63
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:45,989
You're still alive, Big Brother!

64
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,333
Tell me your name.

65
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,836
Your name, Big Brother.

66
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,963
S-Sure.

67
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,467
I'm Shirou. Shirou Emiya.

68
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:06,718
Shirou!

69
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,678
Shirou! Shirou! Right?

70
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,931
Yep!

71
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,522
H-Hold on!

72
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,024
Hold on a second!

73
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,652
We're enemies,
aren't we, Illyasviel?

74
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,320
Just call me Ill ya!

75
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:29,324
Masters can only fight
each other at night.

76
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,202
I came here to chat with you,
Shirou.

77
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,081
Look, you suddenly hacked away at me,

78
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,750
and now you wanna chat with me?

79
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,045
What? That was just an accident!

80
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:47,175
It was all because you jumped
in recklessly even though you're weak!

81
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:51,179
I could kill you right here,
right now, too.

82
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,558
Without Saber,
you'd be killed in an instant!

83
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,357
Besides,

84
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,777
I've been waiting for this chance
all this time.

85
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,238
So, don't I deserve a little chat?

86
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:16,162
So, you're living
in the castle in the forest.

87
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,455
All alone?

88
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,582
No, with Sella and Liz.

89
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:24,546
I sneaked out behind Sella's back
just to see you!

90
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,673
You should feel honored!

91
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,425
Oh, I guess.

92
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,055
Then, can I ask you one more thing?

93
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,685
Does the name Kiritsugu Emiya
ring any bells?

94
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,068
Ill ya?

95
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,655
Don't know.

96
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:54,534
I don't know a name like that.

97
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,495
I'm going home.

98
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:00,915
Ill ya]

99
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,255
Huh?

100
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,215
Emiya?

101
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,764
Tohsaka!

102
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,813
Good timing!

103
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,900
I wanted to have a chat with you, too.

104
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,154
We could chat at school, too, you know.

105
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,365
Archer, can you make us some tea?

106
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,119
You don't want to?

107
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,121
What's with that face?

108
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,832
Jeez, fine!

109
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,303
Huh?

110
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:57,847
This is...

111
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,519
What are you doing?

112
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,523
Now, let's discuss our game plan.

113
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,748
I have to get ready for dinner.

114
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,719
Why didn't you tell me earlier
that Sakura had a fever?

115
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:20,722
'Cause you didn't let me interrupt you!

116
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,683
It's open.

117
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,353
Sakura, are you awake?

118
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,118
Emiya?

119
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,120
Jeez!

120
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,096
Shinji! Let go of Sakura!

121
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,478
Shinji!

122
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,232
Don't worry, Sakura.

123
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,360
I won't kill Emiya or anything.

124
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:19,989
I just want him
to feel a little pain, that's all.

125
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,951
Fight with Rider.

126
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:27,372
If you survive,
I don't mind letting go of her.

127
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,792
Get him, Rider!

128
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,339
If you were going to fight,

129
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,260
you shouldn't have come alone.

130
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,260
What's wrong, Emiya?

131
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,972
It'd be so boring
if you croaked too easily!

132
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,940
You won since you have
good endurance.

133
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,324
Good! Now, don't hold back anymore.

134
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,704
Just kill him off right now, Rider!

135
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:50,955
Stop it, Big Brother-

136
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,480
Sakura...

137
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,067
Senpafl

138
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:32,914
Wh...

139
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,583
Why?

140
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,846
Magecraft...

141
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,334
Rider!

142
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,087
Kill him!

143
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,080
T—Tohsaka?

144
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,332
Why?

145
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,211
Emiya and I have formed a coalition.

146
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,466
It just so happens
that we were together all day today.

147
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,011
Because you used Sakura as bait,

148
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,682
you completely made yourself
my enemy.

149
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,977
Sakura...

150
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:22,773
Sakura, Sakura, Sakura,
Sakura, Sakura, Sakura!

151
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,860
Why do you care about someone
like her?

152
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,446
I was the one who became a Master!

153
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,453
Stand up, Rider!

154
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,623
Damn you!

155
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,751
Don't...

156
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,965
Rider, please don't...

157
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,800
Stop right now!

158
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,645
— Sakura!
— Emiya, get down!

159
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,453
Gotta be kidding.

160
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,579
This is...

161
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,414
Rider?

162
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,047
Good going, Rider!

163
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,591
Keep at it and get rid of them all!

164
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,179
Hey, Rider!

165
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,267
I see.

166
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,353
Matou's bloodline is already obsolete,

167
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,565
and can't produce anyone
who can handle Magecraft.

168
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,068
I'd thought Zouken was the one
who summoned Rider

169
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,779
and had lent her to Shinji.

170
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,157
But it was actually a lot simpler
than that.

171
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,201
Tohsaka?

172
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,537
In the current state of the Matou family,

173
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,957
the one most fit to become a Master...

174
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,796
...is the rightful heir of Matou,

175
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,508
their current Mage. And that's you,

176
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,051
Sakura.

177
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,306
Sakura...

178
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,474
is a Master?

179
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,810
The transfer of Command Spells...

180
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,981
A Command Spell for Rider
to obey Shinji Matou's orders...

181
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,819
With that, Shinji has become
Rider's Master.

182
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:32,820
Hey.. -

183
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,032
Meanwhile, you lost
your authority as her Master

184
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,075
and became an ordinary Mage.

185
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,371
Who are you guys looking at?

186
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,750
Because the Matou family is the one
that created Command Spells,

187
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:49,629
such a trick was possible,
wasn't it, Sakura?

188
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,218
Hey!

189
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,887
Look over here!

190
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,183
We haven't finished yet!

191
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,310
One more time, Sakura!

192
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,605
Give me control over her
one more time!

193
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,527
Why are you acting
so goody-goody after all this?

194
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,946
You have one more Command Spell!

195
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,615
Use that, and...

196
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:22,244
Shinji, Rider will become free from you
if you don't have Command Spells.

197
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,122
And when that happens, even if
you make a False Attendant's Writings,

198
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,833
it'll quickly be burned up,
and that'll be it for you.

199
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,879
Because you were only controlling her
with borrowed Command Spells,

200
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,341
you were never a Master to begin with.

201
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,392
Shinji...

202
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,314
That's right.

203
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,816
I knew that.

204
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,360
I knew that! I knew that!

205
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,778
I knew that!

206
00:19:56,237 --> 00:20:00,116
I knew all along, from the beginning,
I'd never fit this role!

207
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,329
Since I'm not a Master,

208
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,790
you should do it.

209
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,670
Kill them all in my place, Sakura.

210
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:18,300
No, Big Brother.

211
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,803
Let's stop it here!

212
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,348
You broke your promise.

213
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,560
You said you wouldn't kill Senpai!

214
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,313
So, please...

215
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,900
Then, fine.

216
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,319
Why don't you just...

217
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,779
die?

218
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:49,874
Sakura!

219
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,042
Senpai...

220
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:53,627
No!

221
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,337
Don't look at me!

222
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,642
Sakura...

223
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,612
Looks like she can't control it.

224
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,324
Get away from this place!

225
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,410
If we carelessly feed her
magical energy, we can't revert her!

226
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,915
Please don't get in our way.

227
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,583
Pull back, Rider!

228
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,336
Your master is running out of control!

229
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:39,173
At this rate, she'll use up
all her magical energy and self-destruct!

230
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:43,511
It simply means she must take in more
magical energy than she's expending.

231
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,392
So, a change in your master
hasn't changed your rotten nature!

232
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,117
A barrier?

233
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,251
Stop it.

234
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,754
Stop this already, Rider!

235
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,090
I...

236
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:25,302
didn't summon you because I wanted
to do something like this!

237
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,389
I cannot abide by that command.

238
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:33,394
I prioritize your life
more than anything else.

239
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:58,252
No way! Mystic Eyes of Petrification?

240
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,254
Tohsaka!

241
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:19,773
Tohsaka!

242
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:35,331
N000!

243
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:44,173
Sakuu.

244
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,383
Ra...

245
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,229
Sakura!

246
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,071
Emiya,

247
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:08,739
are you all right?

248
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,533
Tohsaka!

249
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:17,122
So, you're finally awake.

250
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:21,752
I just finished treatment
on Sakura Matou.

251
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,379
How's Sakura?

252
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,631
Is Sakura all right'?

253
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,299
Calm down.

254
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,927
We brought her here with Rider's help.

255
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:32,513
Kirei, how is Sakura doing?

256
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:37,685
She's not stable yet,
but her life's been spared for now.

257
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,230
Hold on a second!

258
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,692
What happened
to all of your Magical Crests?

259
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:53,325
I had no choice but to use them all
for the treatment of Sakura Matou.

260
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,327
All of them?

261
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,915
And the result of that treatment...

262
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,169
Crest Worms?

263
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,798
What the hell are they, um...

264
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,176
Just think of them
as living Magical Circuits.

265
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,805
A Crest Worm,
once it sinks its teeth in,

266
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:21,061
infiltrates every last inch of your body,
and voraciously devours your spirit.

267
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:25,274
It pierces through
and lubricates skin with its mucus,

268
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,901
and feeds itself by stimulating

269
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:31,488
then decomposing the part of the brain
controlling pleasure.

270
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,741
As a result,

271
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:39,079
women swarmed by these bugs
are completely violated

272
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:44,084
in both mind and body,
and thus destroyed.

273
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,629
Sakura Matou is also-

274
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:48,839
Stop it!

275
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:54,178
I thought you'd need some explanation.

276
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,056
As long as that thing is inside her body,

277
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:01,185
her magical energy, which is her life
energy, is being sucked away limitlessly.

278
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,853
If you leave her alone,

279
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,481
it will ultimately kill her.

280
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:08,108
The operation was a success, right?

281
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,277
Not completely.

282
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:13,197
The worms accumulated for 11 years.

283
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:17,326
If we forcefully pry them out of her,
she won't last physically.

284
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,079
To completely be rid of them,

285
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,333
that's something you'd actually
have to rely on the Holy Grail for.

286
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,223
Tohsaka?

287
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:47,523
As the one in charge of Fuyuki,
I'll take care of her.

288
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,237
Take care of her?

289
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,365
You mean Sakura Matou?

290
00:26:56,865 --> 00:27:01,787
Yes. I can't allow Mages
who can't control their powers to live.

291
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:06,083
She is already nothing
more than a Master gone mad.

292
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,335
Even if...

293
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:12,214
she is your biological little sister?

294
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,262
Little sister?

295
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:28,063
The Tohsakas originally had
two children.

296
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:31,150
But Magecraft is taught
only to one child.

297
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,862
I inherited the Magecraft
of the Tohsakas.

298
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,449
The Matou or Makiri family's bloodline
had already been severed.

299
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:44,288
So Sakura was adopted by them
as the heir of the family.

300
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,873
Then“.

301
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,251
Sakura and I are sisters by blood.

302
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:54,256
Though, we've never called
each other as such.

303
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:58,177
Hold on, Tohsaka!
Then, all the more reason to...

304
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,061
If I leave her alone like this,

305
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,939
the same thing will happen again.

306
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,818
To strangers, next time.

307
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,279
Indiscriminately.

308
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,615
That's why I...

309
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,242
am going to kill her.

310
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,157
<i>You win, Sakura.</i>

311
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:05,285
<i>So, I'll give you this.</i>

312
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,979
<i>This is the second time...</i>

313
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,190
<i>I've received something important...</i>

314
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,527
<i>from someone dear to me!</i>

315
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,667
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

316
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,807
<i>Sakura...</i>

317
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,601
<i>I've gotta find her before Tohsaka does.</i>

318
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:15,564
<i>But...</i>

319
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:20,027
<i>after finding Sakura, what am I...</i>

320
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,616
Good evening, Shirou.

321
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,539
Didn't you say we fight at night?

322
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,793
No. You're no longer a Master.

323
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,130
I know everything, you see.

324
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:44,551
Rider's Master has also fallen,
so only two more remain.

325
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:48,138
You want to save Rider's Master,

326
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,765
but you can't find her, right'?

327
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,058
SHUT up!

328
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,823
Shirou, you look like
you're going to cry.

329
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,577
Ill ya, aren't you mad at me?

330
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,454
No, I'm not.

331
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,582
I'm on your side, Shirou.

332
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,629
On my side?

333
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,633
You asked me this morning...

334
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,345
about Kiritsugu... I actually knew him.

335
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:33,809
The reason I was born
is to win the Holy Grail War,

336
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:38,980
but my own personal objective
was to kill Kiritsugu and you, Shirou.

337
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,566
But...

338
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:45,987
if you want to protect
someone dear to you,

339
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,908
I'll be on your side!

340
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:54,788
It's only natural to protect
the person you're in love with.

341
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,166
I know that!

342
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:32,159
I've... now lost all places
I can return to!

343
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:43,920
Sakura...

344
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,845
Sefipai?

345
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,806
Sakura...

346
00:32:56,433 --> 00:33:00,437
Let's go home. You're not fully
over your cold yet, right?

347
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,941
I can't go home.

348
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:09,779
That thing earlier...
It wasn't a poison or anything.

349
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:13,366
It's only an elixir
that heightens the senses.

350
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:20,207
With only some of that,
I lost myself and hurt you!

351
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,083
I'm not hurt at all.

352
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,586
I'm totally okay with something like that.

353
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,798
I am a Mage of the Matou family,

354
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,384
and kept that fact
hidden from you for all this time!

355
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:36,389
And I didn't tell you
I became a Master, either.

356
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,558
The reason why I was going
to your place so much

357
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,520
was because I was scared
to stand up to Grandfather!

358
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,688
I said I was helping you out,

359
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,649
but I've been fooling you all along!

360
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:51,613
Always...

361
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,032
I always thought...

362
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:57,661
I'm not someone
who can stay at your side.

363
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,498
So, I kept thinking
that I'd end all of this today,

364
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:05,126
and starting tomorrow,
I'd pretend I didn't know you.

365
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,589
That I'd ignore you even if we pass
each other in the campus hallway,

366
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:13,134
and pretend I didn't know you
after school.

367
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,971
That I'd go home all by myself,

368
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:19,391
and forget everything
that has happened up until now!

369
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,437
But I couldn't do it!

370
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,858
It was scarier than the moment when I
put a knife to my wrist to commit suicide.

371
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:33,697
I was scared of deceiving you,
and I was scared of stopping the deceit!

372
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:37,158
Everything around me was just scary!

373
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,246
I was no longer able to take
even one step forward!

374
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,165
I just didn't know what to do at all!

375
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:52,966
I wanted to protect my time
together with you going forward, as well.

376
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,594
For me...

377
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,471
For me, that was the only thing...

378
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,517
that means anything to me.

379
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,236
<i>The person I want to protect...</i>

380
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:15,697
<i>The person who is important to me...</i>

381
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,369
<i>If I don't want that person
to cry anymore...</i>

382
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:25,332
<i>If nobody is going to reprimand Sakura,</i>

383
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,336
<i>and she has to reprimand herself...</i>

384
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,756
<i>I'll lead her by the hand,</i>

385
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:36,343
<i>and make sure to take her
to a brighter place.</i>

386
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,305
<i>Even if nobody were to forgive her...</i>

387
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,105
I Will...

388
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:53,735
continue to forgive you in your place.

389
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,280
So don't cry anymore.

390
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:01,993
I fully understand now
that you are a bad person.

391
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:10,335
I don't know when I'll lose sight
of myself again, like I did earlier.

392
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,713
I'm sure I'll do something
that'|| be simply irreparable.

393
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:18,760
So where are you saying
someone like me can go home to'?!

394
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,436
This is your home, Sakura.

395
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,946
I...

396
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:40,407
I'm...

397
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,493
not a virgin.

398
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,915
My first time was quite a longtime ago.

399
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,960
That's not all.

400
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,003
Ever since that first time,

401
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:57,757
my body has been touched
by unnatural things.

402
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,760
I don't deserve to be protected by you!

403
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,144
I will protect you.

404
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:11,563
No matter what happens,

405
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:14,566
even if you try to kill yourself,

406
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,527
I'll protect you, Sakura.

407
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,866
Senpai...

408
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:32,041
I will become a hero of justice
just for you, Sakura!

409
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,005
You can't do that, Senpai.

410
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:42,469
I'm sure I will end up
hurting you that way!

411
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,348
I will hurt you, yet...

412
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,401
Let's go home.

413
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,421
Sakura...

414
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,925
Big Sis...

415
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,387
Tohsaka-senpai...

416
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,496
Shirou Emiya...

417
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:57,210
If you kept the belief you've been
sticking with, continue to do so.

418
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,379
The results are obvious.

419
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,842
But if you're going to choose
a different path,

420
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,886
there is no future for Shirou Emiya.

421
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:11,307
You will end up losing
anything and everything.

422
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:29,242
You must be tired.
Take your time and rest up.

423
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,412
O-Okay.

424
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,291
What's wrong, Sakura?

425
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,334
Do you have a fever?

426
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,795
You were in the rain for so long.

427
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:45,300
I—It's not a cold.

428
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,886
My magical energy is a bit...

429
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,846
lacking.

430
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:56,436
Is there anything I can help you with?

431
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,647
Um...

432
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,320
Would you like to...

433
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:12,076
No! I'll be fine if you could give me
a small amount of your blood.

434
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,746
S-Sure.

435
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:18,791
Is this okay?

436
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,753
Yes.

437
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,865
Are you Okay?

438
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:00,291
I-I see.

439
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,878
Well then, g-good night.

440
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,381
Okay.

441
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,395
I shouldn't go any further!

442
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,565
I can't contaminate him
any more than this!

443
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,886
Sakura, can you make a soup stock?

444
00:41:54,721 --> 00:41:55,722
Okay!

445
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,017
What about the spinach?

446
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:01,394
Let's dress it with sesame today.

447
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,938
Sakura, eggs.

448
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,106
Here!

449
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,280
— Thank you for the meal!
— Thank you for the meal!

450
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,914
It's been a while
since we did this last time.

451
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,000
Yes.

452
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,172
You're not gonna eat?

453
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,175
It's okay. Don't be shy.

454
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:39,432
We Servants don't require the intake of
nutrients the same way you do.

455
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,017
Is that so?

456
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:43,936
Saber used to eat a lot.

457
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,817
Your way doesn't suit me.

458
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,944
Well then,

459
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,946
if that's the case...

460
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,667
For our strategy from now on...

461
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,378
I will have Sakura win,

462
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,672
and have her use the Holy Grail.

463
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:16,135
But I think
Sakura had better not go outside.

464
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:19,597
It'd be dangerous
if she saw Zouken in person.

465
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,975
I believe that idea is correct.

466
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:28,022
However,
how will you defeat that Mage?

467
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:34,028
I think we should cooperate
with the other Masters.

468
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,990
Who else is left?

469
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:42,495
Tohsaka's Archer, Sakura's Rider...

470
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:46,082
Zouken has his Assassin in tow.

471
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,127
Other than that, I||ya's...

472
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,045
Berserker.

473
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,844
Is it going to be all right?

474
00:43:58,261 --> 00:43:59,971
Yeah, probably.

475
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,850
Don't go outside, okay?

476
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,442
Are you regretting this?

477
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:19,907
I can't have regrets
after coming this far.

478
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:25,538
Rider, if things get dangerous,
bring Senpai back home.

479
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:28,374
But Sakura...

480
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,836
I think the one we should be
careful of is...

481
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,715
that priest instead of the elderly man.

482
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:39,635
Right.

483
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:43,264
I actually think so, as well.

484
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:47,518
But rest assured, Rider.

485
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:52,440
Because there's no way
he can win against me.

486
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:56,736
Well then...

487
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,658
Senpafl

488
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:08,975
I got it! All I have to do
is keep him from going outside.

489
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:13,729
That way, he won't be
in any danger again, right?

490
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,109
Huh?

491
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:22,029
What was I just thinking about?

492
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,850
Talk about rough trekking.

493
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,902
Guess it wants me to follow, huh'?

494
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,080
Huh?

495
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,209
It's gone.

496
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,676
What happened to this?

497
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:13,516
You sure are a cowardly Servant,
much like your master.

498
00:48:13,933 --> 00:48:17,186
I can't feel any intent
to fight against us.

499
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,607
Do you value your life that much?

500
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,528
Of course I do.

501
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:30,074
My wish is for eternal life.

502
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:33,035
Look at this body!

503
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,622
With each moment it rots,
emitting a foul odor,

504
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,917
losing the knowledge
I have stashed away within.

505
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:46,215
Do you understand the pain
of rotting away while you're still alive?

506
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:51,053
No human is fearless of death.

507
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:58,602
If that was going to grant me my wish,

508
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:05,734
I would run around the entire world
killing every human one by one.

509
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,784
I'm disgusted.

510
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:19,248
You have lost sight
of things that much, Makiri?

511
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:23,502
Remember again
what we earnestly wished for.

512
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:27,756
Remember where our thirst
for achieving the miracle came from.

513
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:32,845
And why we've been striving to reach
the point where we're not human...

514
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:36,515
while keeping our human bodies.

515
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:44,648
Quite the words from a mere puppet.

516
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:48,611
Of course they've
pre-programmed you, huh?

517
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,031
Playtime is now over.

518
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:58,579
I, Zouken Matou, will take
the Einzberns' Holy Grail.

519
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,237
No, don't, Berserker!

520
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,597
Tohsaka! Why?

521
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:02,935
I never thought you'd come up
with the same idea, Emiya.

522
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:31,839
Gotta be kidding me!

523
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,401
Get away from there!

524
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:55,487
If that thing gets you,
you won't be able to come back!

525
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,669
The score has been settled.

526
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,838
I'll leave you to do the rest.

527
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:17,676
Don't let the Einzbern girl go
after all this effort.

528
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,855
Berserker!

529
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:39,990
Ill ya]

530
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,925
Jeez, Archer...

531
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:03,055
Berserker...

532
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,737
I will be your opponent.

533
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:26,787
Archer!

534
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:30,124
I'm counting on you.

535
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:01,488
This is the end.

536
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,040
A genuine Heroic Spirit...

537
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:15,085
could not fight
the Cursed Boundary Layer of that thing.

538
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:20,299
At present, you are not much different
from the phantoms filling this forest.

539
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:42,446
Berserker!

540
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,498
This doesn't look good.

541
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:55,501
Berserker...

542
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:57,294
Berserker...

543
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:01,840
Berserker!

544
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:52,362
No...
No!

545
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:32,903
My duties are complete.

546
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,447
I will leave you to do the rest.

547
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:39,451
How gracious of you.
I can regain the points I have lost.

548
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:45,957
Saber!

549
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:06,478
Ill ya]

550
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:22,744
That's far enough.

551
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,580
You're of no use.

552
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:36,508
You can't kill a puny boy
unless you do a sneak attack, can you?

553
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,218
Pathetic.

554
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:43,890
How could you come here?

555
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:45,642
Who knows?

556
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,185
Archer!

557
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:49,521
Hurry!

558
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:52,774
If that thing catches up, it's all over!

559
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:04,953
We'll talk later. Run, brat!

560
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,455
Now that you've taken I||ya's hand,

561
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:09,624
protect her until the very end!

562
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:18,675
Let's so!

563
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,406
I—low?

564
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,159
How are you able to move?

565
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:47,662
That's obvious.

566
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:52,250
I am not a proper Heroic Spirit
like the others.

567
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:56,755
As I am not canonical,
a little defilement won't affect me.

568
01:01:57,005 --> 01:02:01,259
Which means that I am also
a distorted Heroic Spirit!

569
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,866
Good job, Archer!

570
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:27,869
You can return to spirit form now.

571
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,621
We have to hurry up and get out-

572
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:31,456
Tohsak—

573
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:40,799
No...

574
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,512
Archer!

575
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:50,141
Tohsaka!

576
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:56,022
Hurry up and get out of here, fool!

577
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,327
Magical energy is gathering!

578
01:03:09,828 --> 01:03:11,079
If this keeps going...

579
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:16,001
Run, Tohsaka!

580
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:29,264
<i>I am the bone of my sword.</i>

581
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:32,017
<i>Steel is my body.</i>

582
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:38,023
<i>I have created over a thousand blades.</i>

583
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:47,365
<i>Rho Aias!</i>

584
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:29,949
Shirou...

585
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:34,829
Why?

586
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,082
Shirou!

587
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,127
Shirou!

588
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,129
Shirou!!

589
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,471
I guess this is it for me.

590
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:58,228
Take care, Tohsaka.

591
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,706
<i>Are you insane?</i>

592
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:26,673
If you did such a thing, you would...

593
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,301
Not even worth a thought.

594
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:33,805
If I do nothing, two will be dead.

595
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:37,684
But this way, at least
one will definitely be saved.

596
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:53,241
I'm home, Sakura.

597
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:55,952
Oh, right.

598
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,746
Of course you're surprised
that I look like this.

599
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,666
Yeah, I got slightly injured.

600
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,836
It looks terrible
because it's bandaged so heavily,

601
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:08,131
but it's really not that big a deal.

602
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:14,846
I saw Tohsaka while I was out.

603
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:18,349
She helped me out,
and we have a cease-fire for now.

604
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:21,853
And this is Ill ya.

605
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:25,106
Sorry to be so sudden, but...

606
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,317
Sakura?

607
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:33,990
Can you move your arm?

608
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:35,950
No.

609
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,535
Thought so.

610
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:42,540
Transplanting a body part of a Servant
onto a human is unheard—of.

611
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:44,918
Listen.

612
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:49,714
If you use that arm even once,
Archer's Magical Circuits will activate.

613
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:54,052
And your body won't be able to
withstand the power from them,

614
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:56,179
and you'll collapse from the inside.

615
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:00,225
Then, this cloth is...

616
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:01,935
It's a seal.

617
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:07,732
Tohsaka, thank you.

618
01:07:08,816 --> 01:07:11,444
Wh—What's this so suddenly?

619
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:15,823
I'm going to work with you
until we defeat Zouken.

620
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:20,578
And besides, it's convenient for me
to stay close to her.

621
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:25,750
You're concerned about Sakura.

622
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:28,211
I'm telling you, that's...

623
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:32,590
Besides, if I didn't become
a Master myself,

624
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,635
I'd never have gotten
to know you like this.

625
01:07:38,096 --> 01:07:40,390
That's a little different
from what you think.

626
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,893
I don't know about you,

627
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:47,897
but I've known about you
for quite a while now.

628
01:07:50,525 --> 01:07:52,652
I think it was about four years ago.

629
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:57,782
You were doing the high jump
over and over until sunset, weren't you?

630
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:00,743
I happened to be there.

631
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,414
There was an idiot who kept jumping

632
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,291
even though it was obvious
he couldn't do it.

633
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:09,127
And I was watching him like an idiot.

634
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:15,633
I usually back off from things
if I find them impossible for me to do.

635
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,969
I'm cold through and through.

636
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:21,556
But you know, I'm a Mage after all.

637
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:26,477
So, I was about to compromise, like,
"Oh, well, my life can be fine as it is now."

638
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:30,231
But that was just when I saw someone
who was my polar opposite.

639
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,859
I was pretty shocked, you know?

640
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,211
<i>Don't take it away from me.</i>

641
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:59,677
Don't take that memory away from me
along with other things!

642
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:14,692
Ow.

643
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,705
What if I take this cloth off?

644
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:30,541
My arm might be back to normal, huh?

645
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:53,940
No...

646
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,484
This is...

647
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:00,363
no good.

648
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:10,832
Shirou...

649
01:10:13,584 --> 01:10:16,838
There is something I'd like to ask you.

650
01:10:18,256 --> 01:10:23,302
Sakura's happiness is to have you
stay alive and stay by her side.

651
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:27,098
She wishes nothing else.

652
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:31,060
I'm wishing for her survival.

653
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:35,106
I am rather fond of her.

654
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:44,157
<i>Shirou, do you side with Sakura?</i>

655
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:49,996
<i>Will you, no matter what happens
in times to come?</i>

656
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,626
Senpai...

657
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:00,548
Sakura?

658
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:08,139
Oh, you're low on magical energy, huh?

659
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,475
You can step inside and wait for me.

660
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:15,271
Let's see. Where did I put
that cutter-knife'?

661
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,761
S-Sakura?

662
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:55,311
Senpai, why are you protecting me?

663
01:11:57,605 --> 01:11:59,023
It's because...

664
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:04,862
I'm the one who wants you by my side.

665
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:08,616
I need you,

666
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:13,538
and I don't think
we could stay far from each other.

667
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:18,626
Do you mean you like me
as one of your family members?

668
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:20,461
Or...

669
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:24,715
as a girl?

670
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:34,559
Yeah. I love you, Sakura.

671
01:12:39,522 --> 01:12:40,690
Then,

672
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:42,567
please make love to me.

673
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:55,580
Senpai, am I impure?

674
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,834
It's so strange.

675
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:06,841
I end up like this
just by coming into your room.

676
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:12,096
I try to quench it by myself,
but it just won't subside.

677
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:16,100
I can't think of anything
other than you, Senpai!

678
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:20,855
I'm such a defiled...

679
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:25,818
No.

680
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,362
You're not defiled at all.

681
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,782
You're beautiful, Sakura.

682
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:35,369
Senpai...

683
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:05,900
I...

684
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:07,902
can't take it.

685
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,904
When Big Sister...

686
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:13,115
took you out earlier,

687
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:16,661
I became terribly frightened just by that!

688
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:36,389
I'm sorry I didn't notice.

689
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:44,522
Senpai...

690
01:14:58,494 --> 01:14:59,912
Sakura...

691
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:09,672
I love you, Senpai.

692
01:15:18,723 --> 01:15:20,558
Time for a blessing.

693
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:23,644
Blessing?

694
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:27,732
For what?

695
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:31,736
For the other Holy Grail
that is about to be born.

696
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:35,281
And it has conceived
all the evil in this world

697
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:42,329
that was born from people,
yet never been wanted by them.

698
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:45,082
The whereabouts of good and evil.

699
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:47,293
If it gives birth to something
that can answer

700
01:15:47,418 --> 01:15:50,755
instead of answering the question itself,

701
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,339
what do you think would happen?

702
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:58,345
The answer is near.

703
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:03,058
And what if this question
blasphemes against God?

704
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:07,480
Then, in front of God,
I would give every bit of myself,

705
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:11,567
and I shall question
even my Lord until death.

706
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:22,578
Since you let me stay here,
I'll at least make breakfast for all.

707
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:35,090
I'll go help Tohsaka-senpai.

708
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:37,009
Oh, Sakura...

709
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:39,887
YES?

710
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:42,640
You know, for Tohsaka...

711
01:16:43,349 --> 01:16:46,393
Now, what to do...

712
01:16:50,231 --> 01:16:53,943
Big Sister, I'll wash
the vegetables over here.

713
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:56,654
Yes, please do...

714
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:06,831
Is it strange after all,

715
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:08,666
Big Sister?

716
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:14,296
Th-Th-Th-There's nothing strange
about that!

717
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:27,351
Ill ya, about that thing...
Can we do it in my room?

718
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:30,563
What is "that thing"?

719
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:35,693
I thought we'd need one or two
secret weapons up our sleeve.

720
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:40,698
Archer's arm contains knowledge
of the Einzberns, you know?

721
01:17:41,448 --> 01:17:46,370
I suggested to Tohsaka that there might be
something to make good use of it.

722
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:51,292
I have no interest
in what Kischur Zelretch left behind,

723
01:17:53,252 --> 01:17:58,340
but a treasure box
that he left may be pretty.

724
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,970
Kischur Zel...?

725
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:05,973
Senpai...

726
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:09,268
Um...

727
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:12,062
Thank you very much.

728
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:17,860
I'd always just watched her from afar.

729
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:23,240
I never thought that a day would come
when I could call her "Big Sister."

730
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:29,496
You had no interaction with Tohsaka after
you were adopted into the Matou family?

731
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:30,915
No.

732
01:18:31,206 --> 01:18:37,546
Both Big Sister and I merely knew
we were sisters as a fact.

733
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:41,425
We both tried our best
not to interact with each other.

734
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:47,348
Besides, if she found out
what kind of Magecraft I use,

735
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:49,350
I'm sure she'll hate me.

736
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:53,979
Hate you? Why would that be?

737
01:18:57,232 --> 01:19:03,405
Every single Matou's Magecraft technique
is to pillage from others to start with.

738
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:08,452
All we do is pillage, and there's no skill
to be taught to give back to others.

739
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:14,291
Sakura, do you dislike
the Magecraft of the Matou family?

740
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:19,004
Their teachings were indeed strict,

741
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:23,342
but it's nothing compared to you, Senpai.

742
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:30,349
I once saw you training so hard at night.

743
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:36,230
I felt so many times
that I had to stop you.

744
01:19:37,898 --> 01:19:41,652
Your training was a very dangerous one.

745
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:42,987
It was...

746
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:47,491
as if you were piercing
through your own throat.

747
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:51,912
Even though no one forced you to do so,

748
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:56,208
you stubbornly kept at it
for the longest time all by yourself.

749
01:19:57,209 --> 01:20:02,548
I'm sure that among us,
you are the strongest one.

750
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:05,801
Not because of any Magecraft affixes,

751
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:09,596
but because the very nature
of your heart is so pure.

752
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:23,402
I've known since the day we first met...

753
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:30,242
that you would never betray anyone.

754
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:41,420
You took her from me, Emiya!

755
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:07,404
Why won't...

756
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:10,157
anything happen?

757
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:25,172
MULTIPLE CORPSES

768
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:41,271
That means that Zouken had
the shadow do this?

769
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:42,940
I don't know about that.

770
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:45,943
I don't think he'd leave behind
evidence like this.

771
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:50,405
<i>Next up is tomorrow's weather.</i>

772
01:21:50,656 --> 01:21:52,574

01:21:52,658 --> 01:21:53,784
<i>Yes. Here's the weather-</i>

774
01:21:54,993 --> 01:21:56,120
Huh?

775
01:21:56,703 --> 01:21:58,622
I don't taste anything.

776
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,381
<i>So warm...</i>

777
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:12,427
<i>It's fine. I can still feel this.</i>

778
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:19,101
<i>I wish this moment would continue forever.</i>

779
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:01,310
<i>Walking along, flip-flop.</i>

780
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:04,605
<i>An empty head sways to and fro.</i>

781
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:08,609
<i>Vacating all the nitty-gritty objectives.</i>

782
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:12,446
<i>Trembling, shimmy-shimmy and a go-go.</i>

783
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,949
<i>Singing, tee-bee and a 30-30.</i>

784
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:20,120
<i>Dried-out limbs, just like paper balloons,</i>

785
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:23,540
<i>roll around the ground, tumble-tumble.</i>

786
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:28,545
<i>Huff-puff, floating and flying

787
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:30,547
<i>Go-go.</i>

788
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:33,008
<i>Go-go.</i>

789
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,636
<i>Go-go.</i>

790
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:05,749
<i>Someone is coming by, squeak-squeak.</i>

791
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:09,378
<i>A laughter, cackle—cackle—cackle—cackle.</i>

792
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:13,215
<i>I don't remember fascinating you at all!</i>

793
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:34,069
<i>Because they echo so loudly,
scritch —scratch...</i>

794
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:45,038
<i>the tummy started to rumble-grumble.</i>

795
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:54,631
You're working hard, aren't you?

796
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:58,593
That's why I told you to die
before it's too late.

797
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,067
Twinkle-twinkle...

798
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:15,444
So beautiful...

799
01:25:27,497 --> 01:25:29,374
The grace period is now over.

800
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,419
This is my mercy to you.

801
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:57,569
What? You're still breathing?

802
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:59,613
I wasn't expecting your body,

803
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:01,948
not just the shadow,
to be in the transformation phase.

804
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:34,106
To think you'd attempt to make me kneel!

805
01:27:07,806 --> 01:27:09,391
Damn you!

806
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:33,165
Surely you haven't gone that far!

807
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:06,323
Did you see that?

808
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:08,700
Huh?

809
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:33,517
Shirou!

810
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,312
Come to the living room right away!

811
01:28:43,193 --> 01:28:45,153
<i>Around 22-'30 tonight,</i>

812
01:28:45,237 --> 01:28:48,532
<i>IN FRONT OF THE</i> NEW <i>CITY STATION there Was a
Widespread blackout near the New C/ty Station.</i>

813
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:49,115
IN FRONT OF THE NEW CITY STATION

814
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:52,827
<i>There are also multiple
incomprehensible reports to the police...</i>

815
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:54,704
<i>about neighbors disappearing,</i>

816
01:28:54,955 --> 01:28:58,416
<i>people gone missing
or people suddenly vanishing.</i>

817
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:06,716
Sakura!

818
01:29:08,093 --> 01:29:10,845
Hold on! I'll get med!

819
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:12,389
Saku-

820
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:18,895
<i>Don't notice.</i>

821
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:21,731
<i>Stop!</i>

822
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:33,201
<i>Don't think that it looks like her!</i>

823
01:29:35,745 --> 01:29:38,248
<i>Over 60 victims
have already been confirmed.</i>

824
01:29:38,415 --> 01:29:45,922
<i>The residents of roughly 40 buildings
are unaccounted for.</i>

825
01:29:48,675 --> 01:29:49,968
How is Sakura?

826
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,096
She's alive.

827
01:29:56,766 --> 01:29:57,976
However...

828
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,770
Something wrong?

829
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:05,942
Sakura's body is just connected
to look fine on the outside.

830
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:08,612
The muscles in her arms and legs
are completely tattered.

831
01:30:09,362 --> 01:30:12,824
I'm positive that she died
at some point for sure.

832
01:30:14,534 --> 01:30:17,287
I don't know who got her.

833
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:21,541
But the pain may have destroyed
not only her body, but her brain, as well.

834
01:30:23,126 --> 01:30:27,339
We have to defeat Zouken
and that shadow as quickly as we can.

835
01:30:28,632 --> 01:30:31,092
Let's do everything in our power to do that.

836
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:39,100
But Shirou...

837
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:45,649
What if Zouken and that black shadow
are completely different things?

838
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:47,734
What will you do then?

839
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:02,957
Good morning.

840
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:06,461
Do you still have
a sense of yourself left, Sakura?

841
01:31:08,088 --> 01:31:10,965
Where in the world
did you take in a soul like that?

842
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:14,219
Assassin and Rider are still around,

843
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:17,597
but you're sufficiently satisfied?
This is a surprise.

844
01:31:22,268 --> 01:31:26,648
Sakura, do you know
what's going to happen to you?

845
01:31:28,191 --> 01:31:29,776
I don't.

846
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:32,612
What's going to happen to me?

847
01:31:33,363 --> 01:31:34,489
You'll die.

848
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:36,783
You can't be saved no matter what.

849
01:31:47,085 --> 01:31:48,628
I'm home!

850
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:51,089
I made it back at least a little bit!

851
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:55,385
Wait, Shirou, you're not home?

852
01:31:57,303 --> 01:31:58,471
Who's that?

853
01:32:01,015 --> 01:32:02,308
Jeez!

854
01:32:02,809 --> 01:32:05,562
Where did Shirou go?

855
01:32:05,812 --> 01:32:08,398
When Sakura is very sick!

856
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:15,071
Oh, you shouldn't! Don't get up.

857
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:17,073
Senpai said...

858
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:21,077
he was going to protect me.

859
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:24,414
However...

860
01:32:25,665 --> 01:32:27,167
I'm sorry,

861
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:32,922
because of me,
his dreams will be shattered!

862
01:32:35,425 --> 01:32:36,718
How so?

863
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:39,679
Because“.

864
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:43,975
I'm a bad person.

865
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:50,106
Shirou can properly scold you and tell you
that you shouldn't do bad things.

866
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:55,987
Sakura, you want to fix all the bad things
about you, too, don't you?

867
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:58,198
Yes.

868
01:32:59,157 --> 01:33:01,117
Then no worries.

869
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:05,747
Besides, Shirou's dream
is to be a hero of justice, right'?

870
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:09,292
Of course he has someone
he wants to protect!

871
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:14,255
But that means
he'd protect everyone equally.

872
01:33:14,506 --> 01:33:17,467
If Shirou is aiming
to become like Kiritsugu,

873
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:21,513
it's totally all right for him
to have someone special.

874
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:29,437
Kiritsugu played favorites, too, you know!

875
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:34,025
Even after he started living in this city,

876
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:39,489
Kiritsugu went overseas
over and over again.

877
01:33:40,573 --> 01:33:44,285
All the way until he could
no longer move his body.

878
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:52,418
I'm sure there was someone
he desperately wanted to see.

879
01:33:56,548 --> 01:34:01,135
It's a very painful thing to not be able
to see someone you really care about.

880
01:34:02,011 --> 01:34:04,180
Even for a hero of justice.

881
01:34:08,268 --> 01:34:09,853
That's why...

882
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:15,483
Sakura, please stay by Shirou's side.

883
01:34:33,459 --> 01:34:35,044
<i>Are you going to betray?</i>

884
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:45,889
<i>Are you going to betray
who you used to be?</i>

885
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:54,230
Hey.. -

886
01:34:58,735 --> 01:34:59,903
Stop it!

887
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:03,406
<i>If your answer is "yes ..</i>

888
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:06,492
<i>You are...</i>

889
01:35:08,494 --> 01:35:10,455
Stop it!

890
01:35:21,799 --> 01:35:23,384
No way!

891
01:35:23,635 --> 01:35:26,512
That just can't be!

892
01:35:32,226 --> 01:35:33,770
Shirou Emiya...

893
01:35:34,187 --> 01:35:35,438
Is that right?

894
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:38,608
My Lord Mage
would like to speak with you.

895
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:58,127
Well, you arrived earlier than I thought,

896
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:00,588
Emiya's boy.

897
01:36:01,965 --> 01:36:03,174
<i>Zouken...</i>

898
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:06,678
There is only one thing I will say!

899
01:36:07,804 --> 01:36:10,223
Release Sakura immediately!

900
01:36:11,224 --> 01:36:12,934
Release, huh?

901
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:15,687
I guess you could put it that way.

902
01:36:18,648 --> 01:36:20,400
Shirou Emiya,

903
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:24,362
I called you here today
because I wish to ask you for a favor.

904
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:28,950
I'd like you to kill that shadow.

905
01:36:31,411 --> 01:36:34,163
Isn't that thing one of your allies?

906
01:36:34,998 --> 01:36:36,582
An ally?

907
01:36:36,958 --> 01:36:40,461
As if I could communicate with that thing.

908
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:44,924
I can't even calm it down
since last night.

909
01:36:47,385 --> 01:36:54,350
Oh, before all that, I should tell you
what exactly that shadow is.

910
01:36:54,892 --> 01:36:59,856
Bluntly put, that thing
is the content of the Holy Grail.

911
01:37:01,482 --> 01:37:04,819
The "will" that is overflowing
from the gate called the "Holy Grail."

912
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:07,739
That's what that shadow is.

913
01:37:08,948 --> 01:37:10,283
The shadow...

914
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:11,701
and the gate...

915
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:18,207
I asked you to kill the shadow,
but that will be a difficult task.

916
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:20,376
However,

917
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:23,921
you're still able to kill the gate.

918
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:29,802
It will catch on if it were to be
me or Tohsaka's girl.

919
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:33,431
Servants would be
nothing more than its feed.

920
01:37:34,182 --> 01:37:35,349
Stop it!

921
01:37:36,309 --> 01:37:39,395
The only one who can implant
a piece of the Holy Grail in it,

922
01:37:39,645 --> 01:37:46,235
and kill the "Holy Grail of Matou"
that I nurtured for the last ten years-

923
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:47,987
Stop!!

924
01:37:50,031 --> 01:37:52,241
You have been aware, haven't you...

925
01:37:53,201 --> 01:37:56,579
that it resembles Sakura?

926
01:38:02,502 --> 01:38:05,880
The doll that doesn't do anything
but exists here...

927
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:09,383
will come to an end
by the hands of its beloved man.

928
01:38:09,675 --> 01:38:11,803
Surely it will be the happiest.

929
01:38:13,471 --> 01:38:15,139
We have no time left.

930
01:38:15,932 --> 01:38:18,643
Once Sakura's conscience is gone,

931
01:38:19,018 --> 01:38:23,815
the Holy Grail that has been residing
in her unconscious will surface.

932
01:38:24,398 --> 01:38:28,486
And the catastrophe of ten years ago
will be replicated.

933
01:38:31,322 --> 01:38:33,908
If you want to save Sakura,

934
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:38,162
you must persevere until the time limit
for the Holy Grail War is reached.

935
01:38:38,788 --> 01:38:43,417
Judging from past examples,
that should be about four more days' time.

936
01:38:44,293 --> 01:38:45,294
Thoughts?

937
01:38:45,545 --> 01:38:48,005
Do you think Sakura will last that long?

938
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:51,801
She will! Of course she will!

939
01:38:52,635 --> 01:38:56,389
But other people may not last that long.

940
01:38:56,764 --> 01:39:01,561
It may be full now
from the gorging last night,

941
01:39:01,853 --> 01:39:05,398
but it will be on the move again
as soon as tomorrow.

942
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:08,776
How many more days will it be

943
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:12,905
before every human in this city
has been devoured?

944
01:39:15,199 --> 01:39:16,951
You surely understand?

945
01:39:17,702 --> 01:39:20,580
Vanquishing evil to save everyone else.

946
01:39:20,872 --> 01:39:24,500
If you would like to succeed
Kiritsugu Emiya,

947
01:39:25,585 --> 01:39:28,254
no one but Sakura Matou...

948
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,923
is your true enemy.

949
01:39:54,697 --> 01:39:57,283
Sakura, are you awake?

950
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:02,330
Yes.

951
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:06,292
Good morning, Senpai.

952
01:41:15,027 --> 01:41:16,279
Sakura,

953
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:20,950
is there anything Wu wanna do
after this battle is over?

954
01:41:23,911 --> 01:41:26,998
I can't really think of anything.

955
01:41:27,248 --> 01:41:29,041
I think I'll be all right...

956
01:41:29,583 --> 01:41:31,794
if I could just be together with you.

957
01:41:33,045 --> 01:41:36,799
Then, let's go out together
somewhere and play.

958
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,302
Where would you like to go?

959
01:41:42,596 --> 01:41:48,644
I'd like to go to the cherry-blossom
viewing party.

960
01:41:51,147 --> 01:41:52,398
All right.

961
01:41:54,025 --> 01:41:55,234
That's a promise.

962
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:15,254
<i>Having a warm dream
while the heart is frozen...</i>

963
01:42:17,214 --> 01:42:19,342
<i>Someday, winter will pass,</i>

964
01:42:19,884 --> 01:42:21,969
<i>and when the new spring arrives,</i>

965
01:42:23,095 --> 01:42:24,221
<i>we will go...</i>

966
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:27,641
<i>see the cherry blossoms together.</i>

967
01:42:47,453 --> 01:42:48,496
<i>R/ghf.</i>

968
01:42:49,163 --> 01:42:50,623
<i>When spring arrives...</i>

969
01:42:53,584 --> 01:42:54,710
<i>Senpau</i>

970
01:42:58,547 --> 01:43:01,133
<i>I'm Sakura Matou.</i>

971
01:43:01,509 --> 01:43:02,927
<i>This is the second time...</i>

972
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:04,804
<i>I've received something important
from someone...</i>

973
01:43:06,263 --> 01:43:11,310
<i>I wanted to protect my time
together with you going forward, as well.</i>

974
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:15,898
<i>Senpai...</i>

975
01:44:05,948 --> 01:44:07,283
<i>Are you going to betray?</i>

976
01:44:12,455 --> 01:44:13,539
Yeah.

977
01:44:14,457 --> 01:44:15,958
I'm going to betray.

978
01:44:47,781 --> 01:44:50,826
<i>Thank you so much, Senpai.</i>

979
01:44:51,202 --> 01:44:53,454
<i>You've given me so many things.</i>

980
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:57,333
<i>Thank you, Big Sister.</i>

981
01:44:58,250 --> 01:45:02,004
<i>I was really happy
that I could call you "Big Sister"!</i>

982
01:45:02,755 --> 01:45:06,926
<i>Miss Fujimura, thank you very much.</i>

983
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:13,641
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't keep
my promise to you.</i>

984
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:20,689
Rider,

985
01:45:21,232 --> 01:45:24,818
thank you for not killing Senpai.

986
01:45:28,864 --> 01:45:30,074
Sakura...

987
01:45:35,204 --> 01:45:37,206
This is the final Command Spell!

988
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:41,627
Please, Rider.

989
01:45:48,801 --> 01:45:51,762
<i>I will stop Grandfather.</i>

990
01:45:52,805 --> 01:45:54,807
<i>It's already too late,</i>

991
01:45:55,724 --> 01:45:58,894
<i>but I can't cause any more trouble
than I already have.</i>

992
01:46:02,356 --> 01:46:04,275
Sakura, good morning-

993
01:46:29,842 --> 01:46:32,428
Hey, traitor.

994
01:46:33,345 --> 01:46:36,515
You came home pretty late, didn't you?

995
01:46:42,313 --> 01:46:43,689
U-Um...

996
01:46:44,064 --> 01:46:46,609
Big Brother, I-

997
01:46:47,610 --> 01:46:49,445
Hold this thing for a sec.

998
01:46:53,907 --> 01:46:55,618
It's nothing dangerous.

999
01:47:05,878 --> 01:47:07,379
So beautiful.

1000
01:47:13,427 --> 01:47:15,137
You're amazing, Sakura.

1001
01:47:19,975 --> 01:47:24,647
Maybe you'll surpass
even Tohsaka someday, huh'?

1002
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:31,403
Big Brother?

1003
01:47:40,996 --> 01:47:43,207
Don't get cocky.

1004
01:47:44,208 --> 01:47:47,002
After all, you're nothing but my puppet.

1005
01:47:51,090 --> 01:47:53,384
<i>I made another mistake.</i>

1006
01:47:54,802 --> 01:47:57,429
<i>That's why he's going to do
cruel things to me.</i>

1007
01:47:59,056 --> 01:48:00,683
<i>It's fine.</i>

1008
01:48:01,016 --> 01:48:04,853
<i>I just have to put up with it
for a while like usual.</i>

1009
01:48:06,063 --> 01:48:10,859
<i>Put up with it, put up with it,
put up with it, put up with it...</i>

1010
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:12,528
<i>Sakura...</i>

1011
01:48:13,904 --> 01:48:14,988
No!

1012
01:48:18,784 --> 01:48:19,868
I don't want to!

1013
01:48:20,369 --> 01:48:23,247
I belong to Senpai now!

1014
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:26,333
What's this?

1015
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,712
He's tamed you quite a bit, hasn't he?

1016
01:48:30,921 --> 01:48:32,256
No!

1017
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:35,509
Hey! Why don't you scream
like usual, huh?

1018
01:48:35,509 --> 01:48:38,011
Hey! Why don't you scream like usual, huh?
Why 0'0 I/v/ngs a/Ways <i>end</i> up I/v/s <i>Way?</i>

1019
01:48:38,011 --> 01:48:38,387
Hey! Why don't you scream
like usual, huh?

1020
01:48:38,637 --> 01:48:39,346
Hey!

1021
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:41,515
<i>I've been thinking for such a long time.</i>

1022
01:48:42,224 --> 01:48:44,852
<i>I've harbored hatred for such a long time.</i>

1023
01:48:46,812 --> 01:48:49,481
<i>Why does the world around me...</i>

1024
01:48:50,774 --> 01:48:52,025
<i>hate me...</i>

1025
01:48:52,526 --> 01:48:54,737
<i>this much?</i>

1026
01:48:59,366 --> 01:49:02,077
I'll have to tell Emiya about all this.

1027
01:49:02,578 --> 01:49:07,291
About how much you begged me...

1028
01:49:08,459 --> 01:49:13,547
and how obscene
our intercourses have been!

1029
01:49:17,426 --> 01:49:21,263
<i>I wish someone like this didn't exist.</i>

1030
01:49:43,702 --> 01:49:46,955
Big Brother...

1031
01:50:45,597 --> 01:50:47,349
Sakura!

01:56:01,746 --> 01:56:03,498
