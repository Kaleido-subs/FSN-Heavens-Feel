# Pre-TLC/touchup rough QC pass

## Unaddressed

> 00:06:20: {\i1}Nah, he's just using it.

why is shirou so sure?

> 00:22:28: I can't obey that order.

works, but maybe (uhh, fuck I had a suggestion here)

> 00:53:15: I'm the one you'll be fighting here.

maybe "You'll have to go through me" or similar?

> 01:05:33: If I sit idly by, two will disappear.

not sure about 'disappear' here

> 01:17:53: but the treasure box of a magician sounds pretty.

I think I prefer 'sorcerer' for 魔法使い (mahoutsukai), feels more "mythical" than 'magician'.
Would need consultation with Light's Fate Translator Friend

> 01:23:12: {\i1}Go, go.

TL: Is this 囂々? either way, I don't exactly like this

> 01:29:39: There is currently estimated to be over sixty victims.

'is' or 'are'?

> 01:30:09: She's definitely died at least once.

This feels... weird, idk, kinda like "people die when they are killed"
"It's as if she'd died and been put back together?" or something?

## Addressed

> 00:03:11: Uhm, Senpai.

"uhm" is not timed (Fixed-gsk)

### Addressed in 0571ac0af9aec71b151afdb90302a6b76654e52a

> 00:02:28: {\i1}...{\i0}are{\i1} you?

I realise this is un-italics–within-italics, but it looks like "you" is emphasised here

> 00:06:27: {\i1}I'd better get Tohsaka's thoughts, too.

something about this bothers me, idk
I might like the phrase "pick her mind" here

> 00:07:19: Woah—H-Hold on a sec!

space after em dash?

> 00:07:41: {\q2}What do you mean? \NThat's completely separate.

"separate"? maybe "you've got it all wrong" or something

> 00:09:56: Isn't that...?

refers to ribbons, IIRC. pluralise?

> 00:11:59: Shinji! Let Sakura go!

sakura -> her?

> 00:16:27: {\i1}I{\i0} became a Master, not her!

maybe emphasise "her" too? idk

> 00:16:49: No more of this!

fine enough, but maybe "make it stop" or something

> 00:17:42: They can't produce anyone who can use magecraft.

"produce" sounds really mechanical, is that intentional?

> 00:18:02: {\q2}The most suitable person to be \Na Master in the Matou family now...

"person most suitable to..."

> 00:18:08: {\q2}That would be the Matous' legitimate heir, \Ntheir magus of this generation.

Matous' looks wrong, even though it probably is correct?

> 00:18:13: And that'd be you, Sakura.

while I love contractions, "that would" feels better here imo (in the context of tohsaka's other lines)

### Addressed in 63074df060db930ca9092aedd8ab2fee5f1e16f5

> 00:16:18: Sakura{ this}, Sakura{ that}, Sakura...
> 00:16:20: {It's always }Sakura, Sakura, Sakura!

I prefer the bits with some flavour tbh
(this has apparently already had some back and forth. considering this unresolved for the time being)

### Addressed in 1e2e471c887c9abb1e39516130d32cd22683ca48

> 00:25:07: Think of them as live Magic Circuits. {## \"live\" as in \"live bait\", \"live animals\", etc.}

makes sense, but maybe "living". "live" has a different meaning in context of circuits too (having electricity flowing through one)

> 00:25:19: it penetrates the entire body, eating your life away.
> 00:25:21: It pierces and dampens the skin with its mucus,
> 00:25:25: {\q2}sating its hunger by elevating and \Ndestroying the pleasure centers.

this is great, but if there's a way to make kirei sound like he's enjoying this even more, go for it

> 00:25:54: {\q2}As long as those things remain within her body, \Nher life force—her mana—will be leeched without end.

This might be a place to opt for "magical energy" instead of "mana"? the former is quite clunky in most cases though

> 00:26:05: But you said the surgery succeeded!

surgery? operation? I forget if kotomine does actual cutting here, though the dialogue seems to imply as such

> 00:26:51: Dispose of her? Matou Sakura?

something here bugs me, idk what

> 00:28:05: {\q2}If we leave her like this, \Nthe same thing will happen again.

...

> 00:33:05: That liquid wasn't poison or anything.
> 00:33:10: It was just a medicine that heightens my senses.

medicine? drug? maybe adjust the first line too

> 00:34:47: I wanted to keep holding on to the time we share...

shared?

> 00:35:18: {\i1}If I don't want her to cry anymore,
> 00:35:23: {\i1\q2}if nobody will blame Sakura, \Nif she has to do it herself,
> 00:35:31: {\i1}I'll take her by the hand and bring her into the sunlight.
> 00:35:38: {\i1}Even if nobody else forgives her...
> 00:35:48: I'll keep forgiving you in your place.

I guess this is just shirou being shirou, but man, this reads like nonsensical bullshit

> 00:36:15: What kind of home could there be for me?
> 00:36:25: This is your home.

Maybe change to play better with the first line

> 00:38:21: Nee-sama...

Pretty sure it's only even -san? this sounds more like "-san" to me anyway

> 00:41:21: and I'll just hurt Senpai...

senpai -> him?

> 00:41:51: Sakura, can you get the soup stock?

do you say 'get' for 'take care of'/'handle'?

> 00:42:00: Let's dress it with sesame seeds.

"I was going to"?

> 00:42:11: Thanks for the food. {## gotta love dealing with itadakimasu >_>}

slightly meme: "O Lord, bless our food and our drink. Amen" kinda long though
maybe this: "Bless our meal. Amen." 12cps, also flows quite well (beat-off-beat-off-beat, vs beat-off-beat-off-beat-off in "itadakimasu")

> 00:43:08: I want Sakura to win and use the Holy Grail.

"use"/"get"/"{make a }wish on/with"? current works fine though

> 00:43:12: But I think she should stay inside.

responsible social distancing :umu:

> 00:43:22: But how do you plan to defeat that magus?

"that magus" feels a bit too... dehumanising(?) (as much as zouken deserves it)

### Addressed in ef7f96772fb13669259f1eda2c440615fbea3579

For commit `697955adca02eabb5a0f1cc92b02a0b799df4ae5`.

> 00:48:47: No human exists who does not fear death.

I'd be inclined to use 'man' instead of 'human'
especially considering stuff like this line a bit later:

> 00:49:35: {\q2}Remember why we humans attempted to \Nreach a domain man cannot tread.

mixing 'human' and 'man' like this feels a bit weird to me

I think I get the logic, 'human' for when it's meant to be one person, 'man' for the collective, but it still feels weird

> 00:50:58: Tohsaka? Why?

"What're you... {doing here?}" ?

> 01:06:49: {\q2}If you use that arm even once, \NArcher's Magic Circuits will activate.

"If you {\i1}ever{\i0} use that arm..." or something?

> 01:14:09: When Nee-san took you away earlier,

what was the verdict on 'nee-san', 'senpai' etc?

> 01:15:32: {\q2}It was birthed by humans as \N"all the evils of the world",

Crime Sans

> 01:20:25: that you'd never betray anything. {###}

`###` indeed. I feel like 'anything' is the problem here.
"never betray anyone for anything", maybe?

> 01:21:30: {\q2}Multiple bodies thought to be homicide victims \Nhave been discovered in Fuyuki-shi, Shinto's Central Park.
> 01:21:30: See, look!

maybe \an8 and/or alt style the newscaster instead of Tohsaka? feels weird to have her line in alt style

> 01:27:32: How could you have...

I'm not convinced this is what Gil was saying, but no clue what it would be
gotta love cut-off lines...

> 01:28:45: {\q2}At 10:08 PM today, a widespread blackout \Noccurred near Shinto Station.

nit: I think caps for writing a.m./p.m. is valid, but uncommon?

> 01:30:42: {\q2}if Zouken and that shadow turn out \Nto be two entirely separate cases,

I probably wouldn't use 'case' here

> 01:33:56: It hurts a lot if you can't see that special person.

"special someone"? applies to whole conversation

> 01:34:12: So make sure to keep Shirou closeby, okay?

"close by"?

> 01:36:47: {\q2}Oh, but before that, \NI must tell you what that shadow is.
> 01:36:54: In a word, it's the contents of the Holy Grail.
> 01:37:02: Wills overflowing from the gate we call the Grail.
> 01:37:12: {\q2}I told you to kill the shadow, \Nbut that would prove difficult.
> 01:37:19: However, you can kill the gate.

This seems to conflict with itself. Is the "gate" the Grail or Sakura? (third line is the most relevant one here)

> 01:41:20: {\q2}Is there anything you wanna do \Nonce the battle's over?

'battle', 'fighting', 'war'/'{Grail }War'?

> 01:43:02: {\q2}This makes the second time I've received \Nsomething important from someone special.

probably should be italics

> 01:43:13: {\i1}Senpai!

check timing on these, feels mistimed. notably the very last one should probably have a gap before it.
on successive listens, it starts to feel less off. idk why
(Looks fine on spectrogram, Keep this noted for 2nd QC by basheer.)
