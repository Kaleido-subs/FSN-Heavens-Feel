# Pre-TLC/touchup rough QC pass

## Part 1

up to around 22 min

> 00:03:11: Uhm, Senpai.

"uhm" is not timed

> 00:06:20: {\i1}Nah, he's just using it.

why is shirou so sure?

> 00:02:28: {\i1}...{\i0}are{\i1} you?

I realise this is un-italics–within-italics, but it looks like "you" is emphasised here

> 00:06:27: {\i1}I'd better get Tohsaka's thoughts, too.

something about this bothers me, idk
I might like the phrase "pick her mind" here

> 00:07:19: Woah—H-Hold on a sec!

space after em dash?

> 00:07:41: {\q2}What do you mean? \NThat's completely separate.

"separate"? maybe "you've got it all wrong" or something

> 00:09:56: Isn't that...?

refers to ribbons, IIRC. pluralise?

> 00:11:59: Shinji! Let Sakura go!

sakura -> her?

> 00:16:27: {\i1}I{\i0} became a Master, not her!

maybe emphasise "her" too? idk

> 00:16:49: No more of this!

fine enough, but maybe "make it stop" or something

> 00:17:42: They can't produce anyone who can use magecraft.

"produce" sounds really mechanical, is that intentional?

> 00:18:02: {\q2}The most suitable person to be \Na Master in the Matou family now...

"person most suitable to..."

> 00:18:08: {\q2}That would be the Matous' legitimate heir, \Ntheir magus of this generation.

Matous' looks wrong, even though it probably is correct?

> 00:18:13: And that'd be you, Sakura.

while I love contractions, "that would" feels better here imo (in the context of tohsaka's other lines)

> 00:16:18: Sakura{ this}, Sakura{ that}, Sakura...
> 00:16:20: {It's always }Sakura, Sakura, Sakura!

I prefer the bits with some flavour tbh
(this has apparently already had some back and forth. considering this unresolved for the time being)

## Part 2

22 min to around 47 min

### Addressed in 1e2e471c887c9abb1e39516130d32cd22683ca48

> 00:22:28: I can't obey that order.

works, but maybe (uhh, fuck I had a suggestion here)

> 00:25:07: Think of them as live Magic Circuits. {## \"live\" as in \"live bait\", \"live animals\", etc.}

makes sense, but maybe "living". "live" has a different meaning in context of circuits too (having electricity flowing through one)

> 00:25:19: it penetrates the entire body, eating your life away.
> 00:25:21: It pierces and dampens the skin with its mucus,
> 00:25:25: {\q2}sating its hunger by elevating and \Ndestroying the pleasure centers.

this is great, but if there's a way to make kirei sound like he's enjoying this even more, go for it

> 00:25:54: {\q2}As long as those things remain within her body, \Nher life force—her mana—will be leeched without end.

This might be a place to opt for "magical energy" instead of "mana"? the former is quite clunky in most cases though

> 00:26:05: But you said the surgery succeeded!

surgery? operation? I forget if kotomine does actual cutting here, though the dialogue seems to imply as such

> 00:26:51: Dispose of her? Matou Sakura?

something here bugs me, idk what

> 00:28:05: {\q2}If we leave her like this, \Nthe same thing will happen again.

...

> 00:33:05: That liquid wasn't poison or anything.
> 00:33:10: It was just a medicine that heightens my senses.

medicine? drug? maybe adjust the first line too

> 00:34:47: I wanted to keep holding on to the time we share...

shared?

> 00:35:18: {\i1}If I don't want her to cry anymore,
> 00:35:23: {\i1\q2}if nobody will blame Sakura, \Nif she has to do it herself,
> 00:35:31: {\i1}I'll take her by the hand and bring her into the sunlight.
> 00:35:38: {\i1}Even if nobody else forgives her...
> 00:35:48: I'll keep forgiving you in your place.

I guess this is just shirou being shirou, but man, this reads like nonsensical bullshit

> 00:36:15: What kind of home could there be for me?
> 00:36:25: This is your home.

Maybe change to play better with the first line

> 00:38:21: Nee-sama...

Pretty sure it's only even -san? this sounds more like "-san" to me anyway

> 00:41:21: and I'll just hurt Senpai...

senpai -> him?

> 00:41:51: Sakura, can you get the soup stock?

do you say 'get' for 'take care of'/'handle'?

> 00:42:00: Let's dress it with sesame seeds.

"I was going to"?

> 00:42:11: Thanks for the food. {## gotta love dealing with itadakimasu >_>}

slightly meme: "O Lord, bless our food and our drink. Amen" kinda long though
maybe this: "Bless our meal. Amen." 12cps, also flows quite well (beat-off-beat-off-beat, vs beat-off-beat-off-beat-off in "itadakimasu")

> 00:43:08: I want Sakura to win and use the Holy Grail.

"use"/"get"/"{make a }wish on/with"? current works fine though

> 00:43:12: But I think she should stay inside.

responsible social distancing :umu:

> 00:43:22: But how do you plan to defeat that magus?

"that magus" feels a bit too... dehumanising(?) (as much as zouken deserves it)
