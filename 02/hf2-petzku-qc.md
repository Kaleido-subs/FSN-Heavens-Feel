# Final (yeah right) QC pass

(stuff resolved while viewing not included this time)
>>(yes, some were :bocchipout:)

## Dialogue

> 00:03:10

TV announcer has no subs

> 01:17:36: The knowledge of the Einzberns is in Archer's arm.

"The knowledge" implies it's everything (it's not)
pls2gib TLC

> 01:22:59: {\i1}She went for a lovely walk.

whole sequence: make this like 10x more nursery rhyme-y

> 00:06:20: {\i1}Nah, he's just using it.

why is shirou so sure?

> 01:23:12: {\i1}Go, go.

TL: Is this 囂々? either way, I don't exactly like this
>> Should be rewritten alongside the nursery rhyme bit


## Addressed but subject to change once I look at them again later (Light)

> 00:29:53: TS

maybe TS sign? skippable
>> Probably skippable, but they do put heavy emphasis on it by shoving it right in your face, so maybe worth doing?

> 0:35:18: {\i1}If I want her to stop shedding tears...
> 0:35:23: {\i1\q2}If nobody else will blame Sakura, \Nif she has to do it herself...
> 0:35:30: {\i1\q2}I'll take her by the hand \Nand drag her into the sunlight.

These lines especially are really awkward (but >shirou, so idk)
>> I can't think of much better, either. If we want to touch this, it'll have to be a complete rewrite.

> 00:04:28: {\i1}There's still someone in this town {The pause, this is gonna be awkward-gsk}
> 00:04:34: {\i1}I have to settle the score with.

I dislike these lines but idk waht do do
>> unlikely to change unless a significantly better line is proposed

> 0:38:52: {\q2}If you plan to uphold your \Nprior convictions, then so be it. {## this line makes no sense within this context anymore lol. In the VN, he says this before Shirou finds Sakura, before he's decided to give up on his ideals and save just her. Here in the anime it's just nonsensical because Archer knows he's already given up his past ideals why is anime so cursed aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah}
> 0:38:57: I know where that leads.
> 0:39:00: {\q2}But if you choose a different path, \NEmiya Shirou will have no future.
> 0:39:07: You will lose absolutely everything.

third line "a different path" -> "this path" or something, and adjust rest to match
>> I think it's probably fine if we put emphasis on that he's no longer following his usual path
>> "But if you choose to follow this path, ..."?

## Addressed

> 01:40:25: TS

skipped sign
>> Skippable, and scy has mentioned before that he doesn't want to do it.
>> I may at some point write a list of all the skipped signs I spot, and we can determine if we wanna do them after all later

> 01:10:40: Shirou, are you on Sakura's side?
> 01:10:45: No matter what may come?

Possible tense disagreement

> 01:20:42: TS

books, lol
Franz Kafka – Metamorphosis (no ts required)
Izumi Kyouka (collective works or something)
Lafcadio Hearn – Kwaidan
>> Unlikely to get TS'd, but we can always hope.

> 01:30:09: She's definitely died at least once.

This feels... weird, idk, kinda like "people die when they are killed"
"It's as if she'd died and been put back together?" or something?

> 01:17:53: but the treasure box of a magician sounds pretty.

I think I prefer 'sorcerer' for 魔法使い (mahoutsukai), feels more "mythical" than 'magician'.
Would need consultation with Light's Fate Translator Friend
>> I think "magician" sounds plenty fine here, and sorcerer has other connotations in Fate.

> 00:22:28: I can't obey that order.

works, but maybe (uhh, fuck I had a suggestion here)


> 00:53:15: I'm the one you'll be fighting here.

maybe "You'll have to go through me" or similar?

> 01:05:33: If I sit idly by, two will disappear.

not sure about 'disappear' here
>> I have no complaints about this line

> 01:29:39: There is currently estimated to be over sixty victims.

'is' or 'are'?

> 01:35:01: {\i1}If you will betray him,

I think this should be "would" (light disagrees, but he's dum)
>>no u
>>serious answer though, this question is asked again later on, and 100% in present tense then. He's still fighting against himself at this point, so I see zero reason to use past tense "would".

> 01:29:31: {\i1}Don't think they look alike.

`They're nothing alike.` maybe?

> 01:24:58: {\q2}Had you only the sense to die as I told you, \Nit would've saved us both the trouble.

Fairly fast line, maybe trim down a bit

> 01:21:43: {\q2}I don't know. I don't think \Nhe'd leave so much evidence behind.

split line, TM check

> 01:21:06: TS

Calendar
light wants a sepia picture of illya here, and who am I to deny him
>> The deed has been done :illyagun:

> 01:19:04: {\q2}All they do is steal. \NThey have no teachings for accepting others.

something?
>> Changed for -> about, but kept the rest for now.

> 1:15:28.30: For the other Holy Grail in the process of being born.
> 1:15:31.67: Humans birthed it as "all the evils of the world",
> 1:15:37.85: {\q2}but now it carries something \Nhumans never wished for in its womb.
> 1:15:42.81: The distinction between good and evil.
> 1:15:45.19: {\q2}Rather than ponder that dilemma, what if one were to \Ngive birth to something that held the answer?

All of this is dumb, both lines 2-3 and 4-5.
Suggestions:

```txt
"It has given life to that deemed "all the evils of the world."
Those unwittingly brought forth by mankind.

It bears within it all the evils of the world,
unwittingly brought forth by Man.
```

The rest, idk lol
>> Just went with the second set of suggested lines here. I actually like the 4th and 5th line, so I plane on keeping that for the time being.


> 1:07:29: {\q2}I'm glad I became a Master. \NElse I would've never gotten to know you.
> 1:07:38: That's where you're wrong.
> 1:07:41: {\q2}I don't know about you, but I've been \Nwell aware of you for quite a while now.

rin's third line probably needs changing

> 00:39:44: It's... not a cold...

missing stutter

> 00:28:12: {\q2}Except it'll be random passersby \Nwho'll pay the price this time.

"who'll pay" -> "paying" ?

> 00:03:11: Uhm, Senpai.

"uhm" is not timed (Fixed-gsk)

### Addressed in 0571ac0af9aec71b151afdb90302a6b76654e52a

> 00:02:28: {\i1}...{\i0}are{\i1} you?

I realise this is un-italics–within-italics, but it looks like "you" is emphasised here

> 00:06:27: {\i1}I'd better get Tohsaka's thoughts, too.

something about this bothers me, idk
I might like the phrase "pick her mind" here

> 00:07:19: Woah—H-Hold on a sec!

space after em dash?

> 00:07:41: {\q2}What do you mean? \NThat's completely separate.

"separate"? maybe "you've got it all wrong" or something

> 00:09:56: Isn't that...?

refers to ribbons, IIRC. pluralise?

> 00:11:59: Shinji! Let Sakura go!

sakura -> her?

> 00:16:27: {\i1}I{\i0} became a Master, not her!

maybe emphasise "her" too? idk

> 00:16:49: No more of this!

fine enough, but maybe "make it stop" or something

> 00:17:42: They can't produce anyone who can use magecraft.

"produce" sounds really mechanical, is that intentional?

> 00:18:02: {\q2}The most suitable person to be \Na Master in the Matou family now...

"person most suitable to..."

> 00:18:08: {\q2}That would be the Matous' legitimate heir, \Ntheir magus of this generation.

Matous' looks wrong, even though it probably is correct?

> 00:18:13: And that'd be you, Sakura.

while I love contractions, "that would" feels better here imo (in the context of tohsaka's other lines)

### Addressed in 63074df060db930ca9092aedd8ab2fee5f1e16f5

> 00:16:18: Sakura{ this}, Sakura{ that}, Sakura...
> 00:16:20: {It's always }Sakura, Sakura, Sakura!

I prefer the bits with some flavour tbh
(this has apparently already had some back and forth. considering this unresolved for the time being)

### Addressed in 1e2e471c887c9abb1e39516130d32cd22683ca48

> 00:25:07: Think of them as live Magic Circuits. {## \"live\" as in \"live bait\", \"live animals\", etc.}

makes sense, but maybe "living". "live" has a different meaning in context of circuits too (having electricity flowing through one)

> 00:25:19: it penetrates the entire body, eating your life away.
> 00:25:21: It pierces and dampens the skin with its mucus,
> 00:25:25: {\q2}sating its hunger by elevating and \Ndestroying the pleasure centers.

this is great, but if there's a way to make kirei sound like he's enjoying this even more, go for it

> 00:25:54: {\q2}As long as those things remain within her body, \Nher life force—her mana—will be leeched without end.

This might be a place to opt for "magical energy" instead of "mana"? the former is quite clunky in most cases though

> 00:26:05: But you said the surgery succeeded!

surgery? operation? I forget if kotomine does actual cutting here, though the dialogue seems to imply as such

> 00:26:51: Dispose of her? Matou Sakura?

something here bugs me, idk what

> 00:28:05: {\q2}If we leave her like this, \Nthe same thing will happen again.

...

> 00:33:05: That liquid wasn't poison or anything.
> 00:33:10: It was just a medicine that heightens my senses.

medicine? drug? maybe adjust the first line too

> 00:34:47: I wanted to keep holding on to the time we share...

shared?

> 00:35:18: {\i1}If I don't want her to cry anymore,
> 00:35:23: {\i1\q2}if nobody will blame Sakura, \Nif she has to do it herself,
> 00:35:31: {\i1}I'll take her by the hand and bring her into the sunlight.
> 00:35:38: {\i1}Even if nobody else forgives her...
> 00:35:48: I'll keep forgiving you in your place.

I guess this is just shirou being shirou, but man, this reads like nonsensical bullshit

> 00:36:15: What kind of home could there be for me?
> 00:36:25: This is your home.

Maybe change to play better with the first line

> 00:38:21: Nee-sama...

Pretty sure it's only even -san? this sounds more like "-san" to me anyway

> 00:41:21: and I'll just hurt Senpai...

senpai -> him?

> 00:41:51: Sakura, can you get the soup stock?

do you say 'get' for 'take care of'/'handle'?

> 00:42:00: Let's dress it with sesame seeds.

"I was going to"?

> 00:42:11: Thanks for the food. {## gotta love dealing with itadakimasu >_>}

slightly meme: "O Lord, bless our food and our drink. Amen" kinda long though
maybe this: "Bless our meal. Amen." 12cps, also flows quite well (beat-off-beat-off-beat, vs beat-off-beat-off-beat-off in "itadakimasu")

> 00:43:08: I want Sakura to win and use the Holy Grail.

"use"/"get"/"{make a }wish on/with"? current works fine though

> 00:43:12: But I think she should stay inside.

responsible social distancing :umu:

> 00:43:22: But how do you plan to defeat that magus?

"that magus" feels a bit too... dehumanising(?) (as much as zouken deserves it)

### Addressed in ef7f96772fb13669259f1eda2c440615fbea3579

For commit `697955adca02eabb5a0f1cc92b02a0b799df4ae5`.

> 00:48:47: No human exists who does not fear death.

I'd be inclined to use 'man' instead of 'human'
especially considering stuff like this line a bit later:

> 00:49:35: {\q2}Remember why we humans attempted to \Nreach a domain man cannot tread.

mixing 'human' and 'man' like this feels a bit weird to me

I think I get the logic, 'human' for when it's meant to be one person, 'man' for the collective, but it still feels weird

> 00:50:58: Tohsaka? Why?

"What're you... {doing here?}" ?

> 01:06:49: {\q2}If you use that arm even once, \NArcher's Magic Circuits will activate.

"If you {\i1}ever{\i0} use that arm..." or something?

> 01:14:09: When Nee-san took you away earlier,

what was the verdict on 'nee-san', 'senpai' etc?

> 01:15:32: {\q2}It was birthed by humans as \N"all the evils of the world",

Crime Sans

> 01:20:25: that you'd never betray anything. {###}

`###` indeed. I feel like 'anything' is the problem here.
"never betray anyone for anything", maybe?

> 01:21:30: {\q2}Multiple bodies thought to be homicide victims \Nhave been discovered in Fuyuki-shi, Shinto's Central Park.
> 01:21:30: See, look!

maybe \an8 and/or alt style the newscaster instead of Tohsaka? feels weird to have her line in alt style

> 01:27:32: How could you have...

I'm not convinced this is what Gil was saying, but no clue what it would be
gotta love cut-off lines...

> 01:28:45: {\q2}At 10:08 PM today, a widespread blackout \Noccurred near Shinto Station.

nit: I think caps for writing a.m./p.m. is valid, but uncommon?

> 01:30:42: {\q2}if Zouken and that shadow turn out \Nto be two entirely separate cases,

I probably wouldn't use 'case' here

> 01:33:56: It hurts a lot if you can't see that special person.

"special someone"? applies to whole conversation

> 01:34:12: So make sure to keep Shirou closeby, okay?

"close by"?

> 01:36:47: {\q2}Oh, but before that, \NI must tell you what that shadow is.
> 01:36:54: In a word, it's the contents of the Holy Grail.
> 01:37:02: Wills overflowing from the gate we call the Grail.
> 01:37:12: {\q2}I told you to kill the shadow, \Nbut that would prove difficult.
> 01:37:19: However, you can kill the gate.

This seems to conflict with itself. Is the "gate" the Grail or Sakura? (third line is the most relevant one here)

> 01:41:20: {\q2}Is there anything you wanna do \Nonce the battle's over?

'battle', 'fighting', 'war'/'{Grail }War'?

> 01:43:02: {\q2}This makes the second time I've received \Nsomething important from someone special.

probably should be italics

> 01:43:13: {\i1}Senpai!

check timing on these, feels mistimed. notably the very last one should probably have a gap before it.
on successive listens, it starts to feel less off. idk why
(Looks fine on spectrogram, Keep this noted for 2nd QC by basheer.)
