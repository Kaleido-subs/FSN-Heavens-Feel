# HF 01 QC notes - petzku

general strong distaste of "Holy Grail War", I'd recommend opting for "Grail War" in most cases.

## Notes while watching with light

### Dialogue

> 00:40:30: Yes. It is the reason I'm here.

"it is" but "I'm" is a slightly odd combination, though alternatives aren't too good either

> 01:11:35: Senpai, do you remember?

feels translationese

> 01:14:48: If I ever did something bad, would you forgive me?

compare dialogue in this scene to HF2 rain scene

> 01:15:50: This just in from the front.

"from the front"? feels weird

> 01:27:09: It can sever even a Master-Servant contract.

Archer possibly too certain?

> 01:28:41: A complex number space?

The typical loc for this is "imaginary number space" (plus, kyousuu is specifically "imaginary number", complex is 複素数 fukusosuu)
However, I prefer FGO's version, "Void Space" over either

### TS

> 01:31:02 TS

possibly TS the restaurant sign?

## Addressed already

> 00:02:36 TS

"Don't worry about club. You can come back after you've healed."

> 05:29 TS

HF 02 has "today's topic" above, here below.

> 00:05:45: You fold the shoulder around the back,
> 00:05:49: line the sleeve up parallel to the crease.

a word

> 00:06:00: {\q2}Don't sweat it. Practice makes perfect. \NThis is good for now.

don't like the three sentences on two lines. maybe split into 2-3 events.

> 00:06:53: {\i1\q2}My shoulder finally healed, \Nbut our new lifestyles stuck.

possibly missing "had"

> 00:07:31: {\i1\q2}And finally, and this may seem \Npretty minimal all things considered,
> 00:07:47: {\i1}but I found myself rarely using my own key anymore.

double and? maybe not a problem
remove the "but" from the second line, I think. might happen in colloquial, though?

> 00:11:47 onward

Background lines missing TL. CCs include lines (accurately timed), screenshots shared in [project channel](https://discord.com/channels/482293163633934337/808002575474884618/831287043233022052).

> 00:14:31: {\q2}Starting the day strong by sticking \Nyour nose where it doesn't belong?

move linebraek

> 00:15:04: {\an8\q2}Even if it's spelled the same way, \Nthe pronunciation will differ.

flickers

> 00:15:08: {\an8\q2}It's super easy to get it wrong, \Nso keep your eyes peeped!

"peeled"

> 00:15:52: Oh, she's a second-year. Her name is Tohsaka-

cuts off at "tohsa"

> 00:14:45: Emiya, you're through with the archery club, right?

"I thought you were..."

> 00:17:56: Uhm, I'm sorry! My name is Emiya Shirou.

"excuse me" instead?

> 00:20:50: This just in.
> 00:20:52: {\q2}In the residential district of Fuyuki-shi, Miyama-cho, \Nfour victims were discovered dead in their home.
> 00:21:03: {\q2}According to a press release from the Fuyuki police \Ndepartment, the victims were all found stabbed to death.

first line: maybe colon; possibly alt style/an8?
second: swap order? idk how news would say this.
"their home", or "homes"?
third: awkward linebreak, maybe split
"all found stabbed to death" doesn't sound right to me. maybe remove 'found', maybe 'found with stab wounds'

> 00:32:16: {\q2}Yes. It's an event any resident \Nof this city would know to heart.

"would know to heart" sounds wrong to me, idk

> 00:39:30: {\q2}Us Servants can only exist because of \Nthe mana provided by our Masters.

linebreak between exist and because?

> 00:40:07 TS

minor dislike with many things about this sign (colours, positioning, blur). especially shadow should be darker. I'd position near the bottom of the bottle instead.

> Dialogue: 100,0:59:24.33,0:59:29.05,Default,Assassin,0,0,0,,Narily did I expect such manner of serpent...

"Narily" is, as far as I can tell, not a word. "Nary" should suffice here

> 01:03:54: {\an8\i1\q2}another gas leak occurred in a building \Nin the New City district of Fuyuki.{Kametsu script}

Consistency: "New City" vs "Shinto"
Also rewrite all of this shit

> 01:04:24 TS

Spoken name order

> 01:05:17: {\q2}The residents of the temple were robbed of \Ntheir mana and are comatose right now.

high CPS

> 01:10:47: Uhm, I'm sorry for the way my brother acted.

"uhm" not timed

> 01:11:03: It's freezing, huh? Gimme a sec.

end should be snapped to kf, probably

> 01:15:51: {\q2}Many people need rescue in the \Nbuilding across from New City Station.

maybe "in need of rescue"
shinto again

> 01:29:59: {\q2}But it's likely that shadow's \Nsucking up the mana of this city's residents.

"But that shadow's probably what's been sucking..."

> 01:49:14 Encode

Massive aliasing on the handbag especially
(deciding to ignore)

> 01:59:52: {\q2}This makes the second time I've received \Nsomething important from someone special.

Make sure this and other lines match 02
