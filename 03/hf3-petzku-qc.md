## Dialogue

> 00:01:18: but I suppose my insurance was worth it.

`insurance` is not that good here. if it stays, use `paid off`, but prefer a better word

> 00:01:28: but perhaps it may have done a good deed for once.

I'm having trouble following what Zouken is saying here
might need some more love

> 00:02:22: but you taught her to desire others.

TLC? if accurate, fine, otherwise something along the lines of `desire for herself`

> 00:02:25: {\q2}Now that it has killed its kinsman, \Nit can no longer contain itself.

something about `kinsman` bothers me

> 00:11:36: {\i1}That vessel was a match for the Holy Grail.

`match` sounds kinda weird here

> 00:14:07: So Matou Sakura has become your enemy, I take it?

`You have taken Matou Sakura as your enemy, then?`
Would like some TLC on this

> 00:16:30: And yet he continued to hold on to it.

this whole exchange needs a *lot* of work IMO

> 00:17:59: TS

Left side, missing sign (probably unimportant)

> 00:21:42: {\q2}I could no longer bear the sight \Nof seeing you dangling from one arm.

`dangling by` if that works in english, anyway "from" means the arm is what you're holding on to

> 00:22:49: You're Illya before you are the Grail!

maybe `You're Illya, first and foremost!`
probably needs further thought

> 00:33:33: Even if we aren't related by blood.

unfuck this plox

**stuff above maybe done already**

> 00:47:17: So they chose a single, young man,

this sounds like "single" as in "unmarried", is that intentional? does this need TLC?

> 00:47:22: burdened him with all the evils of the world,
> 00:47:27: {\q2}and tried to prove the goodness \Nof all humans other than him.

maybe something like:
```txt
and burdened him with all the evils of the world
so the rest of mankind{humanity, humans, idk} would be free from evil.
```

> 00:48:10: {\q2}When that happened, \Nthe Holy Grail accepted one wish.

accepted -> granted?

> 00:48:51: {\q2}Because of that decision, \NA{\fnGandhi Sans Extra Glyphs}?{\r}ra Mainiiu failed to be born

`Because of that decision` -> `Thanks to that` ?

> 00:49:34: {\q2}Once that thing is born, \NSakura will never be the same.

`Sakura will never be the same` -> `there's no going back for Sakura`, maybe

> 00:50:18: {\q2}A treasure unlike any other \Npassed down through the Tohsaka line.

needs comma after `other`

> 00:58:34: {\q2}I don't want to let go of it, \Nand I couldn't if I wanted, anyway.

maybe: `I don't want to let go of it.\NNot that I could, even if I wanted.`

> 00:58:45: {\q2}Are you saying that if I take Shirou and run, \Nyou can self-destruct and take Angra Mainiiu with you?

don't like the word "self-destruct"

> 01:00:10: {\q2}Sakura, apologies for the burden, \Nbut form a contract with Assassin.

`but I need you to` maybe? this works too

> 01:05:13: Taking Kiritsugu's place?

sounds more like Illya asking if she'd be taking his place.
maybe `Trying to take Kiritsugu's place?`, though that has similar interpretations too

> 01:05:15: No, Kiritsugu and I are two different people.

maybe something in the vein of `No, I am not him.`, or `No. I can't be a replacement for him.`, or something. fine enough as is too

> 01:05:49: You'd better come back with Sakura by sunrise.

I feel like this would more commonly be `be back`

> 01:06:14: {\q2}I sense a field of some sort \Nbeing constructed in the pond above us.

`under construction`? I guess "being constructed" might work better for this case though

> 01:08:35: Silence. This is my duty.

possible monty python reference: `None shall pass.` Might be too meme since she *just* let Rin pass...
maybe a slightly less memorable line, like "I move for no man", or maybe in a later scene (no, memes are bad, don't do this)

> 01:11:42: Even now, he still believes he can save you.

I think you'd usually not use both "Even now" and "still" here

> 01:12:13: You can't have it.

I'd add a `Well,` at the start

> 01:14:33: Yes, we would be able to break through that way.

`Yes, I believe that plan could work.` maybe

> 01:17:09: This isn't enough to stop me!

even more meme than previous: `Just a flesh wound!`... ok yes definitely don't do this lol

> 01:21:58: {\q2}It connects paths to infinite parallel worlds, \Nand channels mana through them.

no comma, maybe reword too
`It forms connections to infinite parallel worlds and channels mana from them.`

> 01:22:26: {\q2}All I have to do to counter you is release \Nan equal amount of mana in response.

this is better than previously, but still bad imo
original suggestion: `All I have to do is to match your output`, current is probably better though

> 01:24:53: Every day, the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain...

better way to handle repetition? `Every day, the pain... the ceaseless, <other adjectives> pain`

> 01:28:02: I always wanted you to smile.

`to be happy` rather?

> 01:33:29: Th-This is the kind of person I am.

this phrasing irks me much but I'm bad yet again

> 01:38:52: {\q2}Even if you let this thing out, \Nyour wish won't come true.

`That thing won't be granting your wish, even if you do{/manage to} let it out.`

> 01:39:29: At zero, there is nothing but the fact of "existence".

quotes seem unnecessary

> 01:41:07: You, who wishes to protect Matou Sakura?

should be `wish`

> 01:41:17: That is what humans are.

possibly `what Man is`.
remember to check kirei's language on this topic otherwise

> 01:43:02: {\q2}You have no wish for yourself. \NI am your antithesis.

I don't like "no wish for yourself"

> 01:43:36: {\i1\q2}and we both chose a single way \Nof life to seek absolution.

move linebreak, before `way` should be good

> 01:45:43: {\i1\q2}Over five hundred years, \Nour desire lasted but the blink of an eye.

not quite sure what this is meant to say

> 01:47:32: {\i1}Nope. You won't die.

I feel like illya's lines shouldn't be italicised here (yes I see her lips not moving)

> 01:49:26: ya...

should have an ellipsis before or something

## Encode etc

> 01:12:50: aliasing on rider's chains, some on saber's armor too
> 01:35:04: Aliasing on Rule Breaker edge

### probably irrelevant audio issues, apparently present in masters

> 00:13:18: Are you awake?

Audio feels really robotic to me

> 00:24:47: more audio problems, static-y this time

Apparently at least this one is intentional, the first one probably is too.

## Done

> 00:11:21: {\i1\q2}This outcome had been predetermined \Na long, long time ago.

Kirei would use `predestined`

> 00:43:49: Yeah, compared to you... Right?

don't like this, for reasons I can't really explain
more generally, Rin's lines could be more snappy or something

### encode

00:12:59: very bad shimmering on kanji
00:19:29: more shimmering
00:26:06: Debanding blurring shadows on kirei's back?
00:26:21: more debanding gone wrong?
00:27:31: Maybe debanded too much again
00:27:59: shimmering
00:41:46: aliasing
